"the space is cute and romantic including the garden, the service was fair. and the food was average. here's what we ordered: lentil salad spring vegetable pot pie butter clams with gnocci seabass fish special hanger steak duck breast squash risotto kale and celery root strudel brussel sprouts potato cauliflower side i liked the seabass the best, the vegetable pot pie was surprisingly light, the clams were a bit over cooked and i'm not a fan of gnocci, the kale and celery root strudel was not good, the steak and duck were average, the potato was average and the brussel sprouts would be the best if i had stirred it, because the ""carmel"" is on the bottom, it tastes alot better after you mix it properly. also don't come here with a group of more than 4 people unless you are a group of 12 and sit at the big table down stairs, it tends to be loud so you can't hear anyone talking except for the person next to you.",3,the space is cute and romantic including the garden the service was fair and the food was average heres what we ordered lentil salad spring vegetable pot pie butter clams with gnocci seabass fish special hanger steak duck breast squash risotto kale and celery root strudel brussel sprouts potato cauliflower side i liked the seabass the best the vegetable pot pie was surprisingly light the clams were a bit over cooked and im not a fan of gnocci the kale and celery root strudel was not good the steak and duck were average the potato was average and the brussel sprouts would be the best if i had stirred it because the carmel is on the bottom it tastes alot better after you mix it properly also dont come here with a group of more than 4 people unless you are a group of 12 and sit at the big table down stairs it tends to be loud so you cant hear anyone talking except for the person next to you,0

"This perpetually broke Brooklynite is out of place on Madison Avenue, though when one needs to confront someone special with a few macarons, there are few places more lauded than Ladure. Whilst I am not a huge fan of these sublimely delicate creatures that apparently encompass exquisite tastes and textures, I was not the recipient and so I will keep my inconsequential opinion on macarons in general to myself. Having trekked to this very foreign realm, I will report my findings to you, dear members of the Yelp academy: Having initially ventured over to Macaron Parlour, during Macaron Day, we found the fare from that establishment to be rather disappointing - the generic ""chic macaron chain"" that is not wholly disimilar to 16 Handles in the frozen yogurt world, for example. That, combined with their lack of floral flavors, ensured that I would have to revisit this enterprise in earnest when I next found myself on the Upper East Side. My objective was simple: procure a few floral specimens in a box and turn them over to the deserving recipient on the steps of The Met. The simple pleasures, dear Yelpers, the simple pleasures. Upon entering the store I was confronted by a woman in a fur coat (Spring had recently sprung and so - beyond the ethical concerns - there was the fact that it was 60F out) who had clearly been spray tanned rather recently and a gentleman who had that gaudy-moneyed air to him. They couldn't resist the temptation of their macaron box and took to dabbling as they walked out the doors, not caring to savor these specimens, they popped them like Tic Tacs. It was a shameful sight and so I leaped around them and into the elegant storefront. As an Upper East Side institution, Ladure lives up to the neighborhood standards in terms of decor. Thankfully, at 5 p.m. on a Thursday, I was not confronted with the typical intimidating line about which people are prone to complain. One would hope for incredibly friendly staff at an institution at which you are paying an ungodly sum for a bite of a sweet treat. However, the woman behind the counter was rather brusque, perhaps on account of the fact that I only wanted three macarons, for I haven't the funds to support the $200 boxes that are on offer. The token indigent, I asked whether it may be at all possible to have a little box and was told that such an honor was reserved for those who procured six or more. Well, la-di-da indeed! While the macarons at Macaron Parlour were substandard, they had wonderful customer service working in their favor, which was certainly not the case at this pretentious place in which one has to really work all one's charm on the staff to get a smile from them. Admonishing me for my paltry order and tossing them into a bag, I was on my merry way. Eater's report: I ended up with the rose, black current and violet, and the orange blossom. The recipient enjoyed said macarons a great deal and that made the whole enterprise worthwhile. Whilst I only had a bite of each, the finest specimen was the rose, followed by the orange blossom and then the black current and violent, the latter of which possessed a flavor that was saccharine sweet and consequently lacked the delicacy and subtleness of the other macarons. Conclusion: These are supposed to be the best macarons in the city and they are excellent, to be sure. This place is also very much on the ""splurge"" end of the spectrum and, with the masses flocking to this popular establishment, one could be confronted with ungodly lines in order to spend a small fortune on treats of the all-too-fleeting-a-pleasure variety. If you are in the market to buy somebody special a culinary treat, you may have to brave the questionable service and extortionate prices, for these macarons are probably - for now at least - the best in show in the competitive NYC macaron scene.",4,This perpetually broke Brooklynite is out of place on Madison Avenue though when one needs to confront someone special with a few macarons there are few places more lauded than Ladure Whilst I am not a huge fan of these sublimely delicate creatures that apparently encompass exquisite tastes and textures I was not the recipient and so I will keep my inconsequential opinion on macarons in general to myself Having trekked to this very foreign realm I will report my findings to you dear members of the Yelp academy Having initially ventured over to Macaron Parlour during Macaron Day we found the fare from that establishment to be rather disappointing the generic chic macaron chain that is not wholly disimilar to 16 Handles in the frozen yogurt world for example That combined with their lack of floral flavors ensured that I would have to revisit this enterprise in earnest when I next found myself on the Upper East Side My objective was simple procure a few floral specimens in a box and turn them over to the deserving recipient on the steps of The Met The simple pleasures dear Yelpers the simple pleasures Upon entering the store I was confronted by a woman in a fur coat Spring had recently sprung and so beyond the ethical concerns there was the fact that it was 60F out who had clearly been spray tanned rather recently and a gentleman who had that gaudymoneyed air to him They couldnt resist the temptation of their macaron box and took to dabbling as they walked out the doors not caring to savor these specimens they popped them like Tic Tacs It was a shameful sight and so I leaped around them and into the elegant storefront As an Upper East Side institution Ladure lives up to the neighborhood standards in terms of decor Thankfully at 5 pm on a Thursday I was not confronted with the typical intimidating line about which people are prone to complain One would hope for incredibly friendly staff at an institution at which you are paying an ungodly sum for a bite of a sweet treat However the woman behind the counter was rather brusque perhaps on account of the fact that I only wanted three macarons for I havent the funds to support the 200 boxes that are on offer The token indigent I asked whether it may be at all possible to have a little box and was told that such an honor was reserved for those who procured six or more Well ladida indeed While the macarons at Macaron Parlour were substandard they had wonderful customer service working in their favor which was certainly not the case at this pretentious place in which one has to really work all ones charm on the staff to get a smile from them Admonishing me for my paltry order and tossing them into a bag I was on my merry way Eaters report I ended up with the rose black current and violet and the orange blossom The recipient enjoyed said macarons a great deal and that made the whole enterprise worthwhile Whilst I only had a bite of each the finest specimen was the rose followed by the orange blossom and then the black current and violent the latter of which possessed a flavor that was saccharine sweet and consequently lacked the delicacy and subtleness of the other macarons Conclusion These are supposed to be the best macarons in the city and they are excellent to be sure This place is also very much on the splurge end of the spectrum and with the masses flocking to this popular establishment one could be confronted with ungodly lines in order to spend a small fortune on treats of the alltoofleetingapleasure variety If you are in the market to buy somebody special a culinary treat you may have to brave the questionable service and extortionate prices for these macarons are probably for now at least the best in show in the competitive NYC macaron scene,0

"Been a fan of Teva Tirra for a few years now. In fact, that's why I have 10 pairs of the Tirra sandals in assorted colors and now 2 of the Tirra slides. It's very comfortable, has great foot support, durable, good traveling/adventure sandal, and I never worry about getting caught in the rain or stepping in a puddle. It fits my island lifestyle and it's cute with sportswear or adventure clothing--which is what I wear on a day-to-day basis.

This is by far the best burger joint ever. I have tried multiple burger places. I had such high expectations for this place and i was skeptical about it since i heard such high expectations. However the moment i took my first bite. I was in heaven. I had never tasted such a good looking burger that will melt in my mouth. Every bite was just better than previous and left me craving some more. The line is definitely on the long side but it is worthhhh every second! Every person in the world has to try this! My mouth waters as i think about the burgers and if there was one food i had t ochoose to eat for the rest of my life. This would be it. without a doubt,5,This is by far the best burger joint ever I have tried multiple burger places I had such high expectations for this place and i was skeptical about it since i heard such high expectations However the moment i took my first bite I was in heaven I had never tasted such a good looking burger that will melt in my mouth Every bite was just better than previous and left me craving some more The line is definitely on the long side but it is worthhhh every second Every person in the world has to try this My mouth waters as i think about the burgers and if there was one food i had t ochoose to eat for the rest of my life This would be it without a doubt,0
"Went the first day they opened to the public. It was good...nothing amazing, but really good. it's a great addition to vanderbilt and i think it will do well. They don't give you much ramen especially considering it's $12, but it's all pretty tasty and i was okay with the portion size. I got the chicken with soy broth. it was tasty. could have used a little more salt. My friend got the pork with pork broth. the pork was almost like thick not-salty bacon. I had a bite that was okay. My friend really liked it. I think it could have used a little more flavor. The peppers appetizer was really good. a little too salty but I think it's supposed to be like that. The chicken salad appetizer was great. I really recommend that one. The chicken was so soft. The place seemed a little overstaffed but it still took a while to order and a while to get food and a long time to pay. They just weren't paying that much attention to customers. But it was their first day. I'm sure it will be a lot smoother soon. They were extremely nice when they did pay attention to us. They also comp'd us the chicken salad because our ramen was taking a little long. I will go again and I recommend it especially if you're a big ramen fan.",3,Went the first day they opened to the public It was goodnothing amazing but really good its a great addition to vanderbilt and i think it will do well They dont give you much ramen especially considering its 12 but its all pretty tasty and i was okay with the portion size I got the chicken with soy broth it was tasty could have used a little more salt My friend got the pork with pork broth the pork was almost like thick notsalty bacon I had a bite that was okay My friend really liked it I think it could have used a little more flavor The peppers appetizer was really good a little too salty but I think its supposed to be like that The chicken salad appetizer was great I really recommend that one The chicken was so soft The place seemed a little overstaffed but it still took a while to order and a while to get food and a long time to pay They just werent paying that much attention to customers But it was their first day Im sure it will be a lot smoother soon They were extremely nice when they did pay attention to us They also compd us the chicken salad because our ramen was taking a little long I will go again and I recommend it especially if youre a big ramen fan,0

They start you off with a selection of breads and a croissant with jelly and butter, which was a nice touch. I split the market burger and brisket sandwich and have to give the tie to the runner, brisket for the win. Also, had chinese broccoli which was really garlicy, but very tasty as well.

"I am from Buffalo, and last night I was DYING for a good wing. When I say dying for I mean I had an insatiable craving for buttery spicy fried fowl. I did a lil searching and went to Bonnie's Grill. The gentleman who appeared to be running the restaurant that night immediately recognized me as his fellow Buffalonian and introduced himself as a native of the Tonatonawana. If you don't know that what means, don't ask. I order a plate of 10 wings, hot, xtra crispy. They came out exactly as ordered and were plump, nice sized wings. The only thing that distracted me from how delicious they were was the fact that i was washing them down with a $3.00 LABATT BLUE...! Sweet lord almighty if you're from WNY and want wings go to Bonnies, They're not quite the Bar Bill, but they're a fantastic substitute while living down here.. PS: Dear Bonnie's Cheeseburger, I saw you sitting there atop your freshly grilled poppyseed bun, looking so wonderfully spiced and cooked to a perfect mid-rare.

"Bed frames hold up a mattress, and usually, that is all they do. This one is the first one I have ever owned that made the mattress feel more supportive, more flat, and all around better to sleep on. And the mattress is a top of the line Royal Pedic. This frame is built like a military war machine but anyone of average intelligence can assemble it, without tools of any kind, in about ten minutes. No matter how you interpret the instructions put the wheels on first. To get them to seat in the plastic inserts you will need a hard ( tile, concrete, steel, etc.) surface and straight line pressure. Once in the plastic insert the wheels will easily seat in the frame. The center ""T"" will only fit one way. Do not force it. If you are doing it properly, it will drop right in. Get the wheeled version and off-set the locking wheels at opposite ends and sides. When it is time to clean under the frame, you will be glad those wheels are helping you move it. Don't worry about the cost. You will never have to buy another bed frame, no matter how long you live, and you will never find one that will support your mattress and you nearly as well as this one.",5,Bed frames hold up a mattress and usually that is all they do This one is the first one I have ever owned that made the mattress feel more supportive more flat and all around better to sleep on And the mattress is a top of the line Royal Pedic This frame is built like a military war machine but anyone of average intelligence can assemble it without tools of any kind in about ten minutes No matter how you interpret the instructions put the wheels on first To get them to seat in the plastic inserts you will need a hard tile concrete steel etc surface and straight line pressure Once in the plastic insert the wheels will easily seat in the frame The center T will only fit one way Do not force it If you are doing it properly it will drop right in Get the wheeled version and offset the locking wheels at opposite ends and sides When it is time to clean under the frame you will be glad those wheels are helping you move it Dont worry about the cost You will never have to buy another bed frame no matter how long you live and you will never find one that will support your mattress and you nearly as well as this one,0
"I was physically removed from the sangria table! Who said I can't put a big straw in each selection like a personal IV cord? That was not on the House Rules list! Seriously, this place rocks for brunch! Unlimited sangria? Eight different types! Hell yeah baby! We had a reservation for 12:30 brunch and made sure we were there by noon. When we walked in there was a crowd waiting around the host desk. Checked in and we were whisked away ahead of the crowd after only waiting about 5 minutes. I guess many of those waiting did not have reservations. We were led past a very nice bar and lounge type area to a hallway that let to the enormous main dining room. This place is huge and you would never know from the outside. Wow - the main dining area has multiple rooms, eclectic decorations, murals on the walls, bright colors, funky giant lampshades, and terrific wooden architecture on the ceiling. Miami in the house! We were led to a table that was right across the sangria bar - jackpot! All types of flavors and unlimited with the cost of an entree as long as you are eating there. We ate very slowly today! The place was bustling, staff were constantly running from table to table, sangria was constantly being poured and refilled. Latin music is playing. It is quite a fun scene here as everyone seemed to be in great spirits. Maybe it was because of the sangria high? Our waitress was friendly and gave us some suggestions on what to eat and she was right on. We had the Vaca Frita (Cuban skirt steak) and the Pollo Ranchero (chicken, scrambles eggs, tortilla, black beans, sauce) and both were delicious. Plus, the bread basket you get has some great muffins and biscuits. That cheese biscuit thing is awesome and the strawberry butter adds great flavor. I literally only had to walk five steps to get to the sangria table and made that trek constantly! Our faves were the Roja, Tropical, Harlem, Fresas, and Havana. All full of fresh fruit. Some are on the sweet side and some are on the dry side, so it is up to personal preference. Another good tip is to make sure you get a big glass and hold onto it, as those go quick, and then you are stuck with the smaller versions. Table is set up as self serve and pitchers with ladles are there for constant pouring. Also, another fun option is to get the taco cart for an additional $8. A server runs around the place ringing a bell on this taco cart and will come to your table and set you up with all the ingredients for a tasty taco adventure. We did not do this but the table next to us did and it looked good. We had to look over the dessert list and decided to share the Bombas, which are doughnuts filled with creme and covered in brown suger. You also get a scoop of this AMAZING banana ice cream! Holy cow was that good. So much flavor i could have eaten a pint of it right there. This place is great for groups, couples, parties, and bringing visitors for a fun afternoon. Reservations are a must! Our whole bill came out to around $43 - super bargain considering all the sangria we drank and the food we ate. Service was quick and attentive, and we never felt rushed at all. Overall, food tasted good and sangria was full of flavor and fruit. Could not have asked for a better brunch experience.

"I love this place, the shabu shabu with the rib eye is one of those classic dishes that are just simple yet sooo good. Its pretty much a bowl of boiling water that comes with raw rib eye (thinly sliced) and a plate of veggies, noodles, etc. The order comes with 2 dipping sauses which make everything so much better. I think 4 people is the ideal number of people to go with because its a really good meal for conversation.

"I would say I'm pretty easy to please, and I'm not as critical as some maybe on this site. After going to yelp for help in finding a new Mexican restaurant in Queens I was directed to De Mole. First impressing is the size, so tiny. Maybe about ten or twelve tables. So we had to wait. Witch to me isn't a problem. After being seated we put in our order because we had ample time to read the menu as we were waiting. I ordered the red enchiladas, kinda my staple when I go to a mexican place and for me you can tell a lot about a place from their enchiladas. We also ordered some tamales for a started as well as and orange flan for dessert. As we waited for our food conversing and eating some chips we found as we neard the bottom that there was a piece of glass in it. I told the waiter just to make sure he wasn't serving glass to everyone as someone could get hurt. So the enchiladas were ok the sauce is what made them. To me they lacked seasoning. I think it's just the base chicken. If you don't boil the chicken down with a ton of seasoning then it's going to come out bland. The rice was also a little on the crunchy side. Even the tamale was so so. The orange flan was the only high light. And the price is right. Just remember you get what you pay for.

"Came here to try the legendary Black Label Burger, which I have to say was really good, but not sure it's worth the hype. But when I crave a burger, I typically go to JG Melon, the Burger Joint or the Shake Shack, so maybe this burger was just too high brow for my tastes. The place itself is great - felt like I was stepping back in time to the 1930s although it does feel cramped inside. Also had the coconut cake for desert which was excellent - not too sweet and perfectly moist. Will definitely come back to try the non-burger items another time.",3,Came here to try the legendary Black Label Burger which I have to say was really good but not sure its worth the hype But when I crave a burger I typically go to JG Melon the Burger Joint or the Shake Shack so maybe this burger was just too high brow for my tastes The place itself is great felt like I was stepping back in time to the 1930s although it does feel cramped inside Also had the coconut cake for desert which was excellent not too sweet and perfectly moist Will definitely come back to try the nonburger items another time,0
Not worth the time. I called this place to order and they answered and upon asking for delivery they stated they were then closed. Apparently they closed 15 minutes earlier. So why answer the phone and ask how you can help if your closed? Very unprofessional especially when holiday hours were posted as open until 1130pm. Plenty of other Thai places to go.,1,Not worth the time I called this place to order and they answered and upon asking for delivery they stated they were then closed Apparently they closed 15 minutes earlier So why answer the phone and ask how you can help if your closed Very unprofessional especially when holiday hours were posted as open until 1130pm Plenty of other Thai places to go,0
"I'm a big fan of this place, especially the outdoor seating in the warmer months. You won't be forgotten outside (as is sadly the case at many restaurants). The wine list is great.

I had a nice reserved table with my girls tonight. The atmosphere is very laid back and cozy. Our waitress was really attentive which I like. I suggested one of my friends to try the Bash Style Burger because there were a lot reviews on this particular burger. I got the Southern Fried Chicken and my other friend got the Pappadella (how ever you spelled it) with a side order of Tarter Tots. I love how the cornish hen was very well seasoned that I didn't need to dip in ketchup and yummy crispy skin. The Tarter Tots were so superbly delicious with a hint of Oregano that my friend pointed out or some kind of herb. I am happy the food was portion size because it leaves room for dessert.

"Lombardi's was always a favorite place for me to take my friends who were visiting me in New York because it really is a slice of New York as I know it. Their toppings always taste fresh, and it kind of saddens me that I can't partake of their deliciousness anymore since I've moved back to the Bay Area. Their White Pizza is a must for fans of ricotta cheese like myself, but I'd recommend the red sauce if you prefer something that's more moist and not as outrageously cheesy. I've never really had a pizza go wrong here and I must have come here more than 15 times in the course of some two years. There will always be a wait of some sort, so anticipate that, but they do have a lot of hidden seating for what looks like a small establishment.",4,Lombardis was always a favorite place for me to take my friends who were visiting me in New York because it really is a slice of New York as I know it Their toppings always taste fresh and it kind of saddens me that I cant partake of their deliciousness anymore since Ive moved back to the Bay Area Their White Pizza is a must for fans of ricotta cheese like myself but Id recommend the red sauce if you prefer something thats more moist and not as outrageously cheesy Ive never really had a pizza go wrong here and I must have come here more than 15 times in the course of some two years There will always be a wait of some sort so anticipate that but they do have a lot of hidden seating for what looks like a small establishment,0
Phenomenal place. The food is delicious and wont leave you feeling stuffed or bloated. Portions are an ideal size. Very intimate and romantic ambience. I loved the entrance curtains; gives it sense of drama. The owner is the nicest person imaginable. He took our coats himself and had them hung. I saw him going table to table chatting with the large groups of people having dinner. This place was packed. He came over to us a few times to check up on everything. He's doing right what many restaurants owners do wrong. He's actually engaging his customers and is open to advice and suggestions. He hugged as we were leaving and helped my girlfriend with her coat. He is the restaurant. One of the best Italian places in the city.

"The brunch here is crazy good AND a great price! Win for Upper East Side. It was $17 for a brunch entree and a drink (awesome Bloody Mary). They sat us immediately and the apps were delicious. Definitely get the honey glazed cornbread and the fresh ricotta. So good. I ordered the burger which comes with the works, some type of sauce and bacon onion jam. It was a really tasty choice, but I think I'll have the chicken and waffles next time because they looked delicious too :) The inside is really cutely decorated, loved the feel of it and all the photographs on the walls. Our booth was very cozy. The only reason a star is knocked off is because we waited really long for our entrees, I believe over 35 minutes. It might have been the crippling hunger but we were very aware of the gap between courses.

"The two things that I highly recommend: steak taquitos and of course, the corn. I think it's quite obvious from all the reviews that their corn is a must-try/must-get. If you're iffy about the cheese, don't be. If you're iffy about the spicy level, don't be. The ingredients work so well together, it's like an explosion of flavors! Party in your mouth. And sadly teeth too... but corn is like that. Now for the taquitos. To be honest, when the dish arrived I was a little disappointed because it was not fried...BUT when something is supposed to be fried but isn't and tastes good anyway? You know it's good. I wouldn't come here to sit down and eat. It's is way too cramped inside and if you skip out on the entrees, you're not missing much.

"was in brooklyn last night and had decided on a meal at dinosaur bbq BUT after picking up our third party she convinced us to try fette sau. when we drove by i saw the huge line outside which for me indicates two things .. a long wait and NOT my ideal restaurant experience. i HATE waiting at restaurants especially outdoors. in any case, we sucked it up and waited. first thing i will say is that i HATE the seating. they have three large picnic type tables and when its crowded you literally have to fight for seating and if people dont eat fast enough you could very well be left standing holding a tray of food and have nowhere to sit. im also not a fan of communal style seating. i prefer my own table with my companions. food was served and priced by the pound. as we were waiting in line we decided to try a quarter pound of every meat on the menu however before we even got to the front of the line they ran out of bbq sausage so we were limited to ribs, pulled pork, brisket, and chicken. we literally got the last piece of chicken and although they do have pork belly, we ordered it but the server forgot to put it on our tray. anyway, the food was decent but i dont think you really get alot for your money. when i ordered, the guy weighing the meat asked me how many people were in our party and i replied that there were three of us and he said that we ordered alot of food but in reality it wasnt. we could have easily eaten more. bottom ,line, it was an okay experience. i would go back and i would also recommend it to others. just dont go on a friday night unless u wanna wait outside for 30 mins or more.",3,was in brooklyn last night and had decided on a meal at dinosaur bbq BUT after picking up our third party she convinced us to try fette sau when we drove by i saw the huge line outside which for me indicates two things a long wait and NOT my ideal restaurant experience i HATE waiting at restaurants especially outdoors in any case we sucked it up and waited first thing i will say is that i HATE the seating they have three large picnic type tables and when its crowded you literally have to fight for seating and if people dont eat fast enough you could very well be left standing holding a tray of food and have nowhere to sit im also not a fan of communal style seating i prefer my own table with my companions food was served and priced by the pound as we were waiting in line we decided to try a quarter pound of every meat on the menu however before we even got to the front of the line they ran out of bbq sausage so we were limited to ribs pulled pork brisket and chicken we literally got the last piece of chicken and although they do have pork belly we ordered it but the server forgot to put it on our tray anyway the food was decent but i dont think you really get alot for your money when i ordered the guy weighing the meat asked me how many people were in our party and i replied that there were three of us and he said that we ordered alot of food but in reality it wasnt we could have easily eaten more bottom line it was an okay experience i would go back and i would also recommend it to others just dont go on a friday night unless u wanna wait outside for 30 mins or more,0
"Went to Maialino for their weekend brunch. The service, atmosphere, and food were impeccable. My grandmother and I both had the ricotta pancakes and assorted pastries. She had a pot of french press coffee and I had a bloody mary. The pancakes were surprisingly thin and fluffy. The scoop of ricotta cheese on them was quite possibly the best I've ever had. My grandmother finished a whole pot of coffee, and the Maialino version of a bloody mary was interesting and tasty. However, by far the best part of the meal was the assorted pastries. We had several olive oil muffins, a monkey something-or-other, a scone, croissants, and mini donuts with cream. The mini donuts were amazing. It was a party in my mouth. The muffins were moist and fluffy. Everything was perfect. I can't wait for the place to be open for lunch, as I'm sure that will be equally impressive as breakfast.",4,Went to Maialino for their weekend brunch The service atmosphere and food were impeccable My grandmother and I both had the ricotta pancakes and assorted pastries She had a pot of french press coffee and I had a bloody mary The pancakes were surprisingly thin and fluffy The scoop of ricotta cheese on them was quite possibly the best Ive ever had My grandmother finished a whole pot of coffee and the Maialino version of a bloody mary was interesting and tasty However by far the best part of the meal was the assorted pastries We had several olive oil muffins a monkey somethingorother a scone croissants and mini donuts with cream The mini donuts were amazing It was a party in my mouth The muffins were moist and fluffy Everything was perfect I cant wait for the place to be open for lunch as Im sure that will be equally impressive as breakfast,0

"Came here with a coworker on a Thursday afternoon, probably around 2:30? For a late lunch. For an off time, they surprisingly had quite a few customers. Not a huge menu, but the options they have sound one more delicious than the next (and I have no doubt each one is actually better than the next) The wait staff is super helpful with indecisive customers (just talking about myself here) and gives great tips on what to order with what. The prices are so reasonable that my coworker and I ordered three dishes..each. The prices are deceptive but the portions are perfect. Two would have been fine each, three was excessive - but we sure weren't complaining... or stopping until we hit ceramic. I ordered Flautas; 1 chicken, 1 potato. Yum yum yummy. I preferred the chicken, because I am not a big potato fan, but the potato was still delicious. Tip: DRENCH them in that red sauce they give you on the side. I could have had that dipping sauce as my meal. Superb. Then I ordered one of the appetizers that was the special. Stuffed Avocado with diced shrimp, diced tomato coated in some beautiful sauce with chips on the side. My dear lord. Order two and make it a reason to come here in the first place. I never wanted it to end. Even if it's not listed or mentioned as a special for the day... request it and act like you've had it before. YOU'LL BE SO HAPPY. Lastly, I ordered the Chicken Quesadilla. Very yummy, well cooked and it only was my least favorite because of it's two predecessors. You will be very happy with the quesadilla, but any act that has to perform after that avocado dreamland number is sure to pale in comparison.

For first-time goers like myself, I was completely lost. There are two entrances as well which doesn't really help matters. My friend and I saw a line and figured that's where the seating line is but lo and behold after asking the guy in fornt of me, I realized its a line for the roof- Beer Gardens apparently. So, back to square one. No big signs, no directions, no nothing. While the staff is very friendly and warm, the people who come here to eat and mingle are just plain rude.

"[4.5 stars] I went to Pylos with a group of girlfriends for dinner back in May sometime. The interior of the restaurant is beautiful--really cozy and unique. There are huge mirrors against the wall that make the space look bigger and this cool jugs all over the ceiling. We sat in a comfortable little booth in the back. The pita and fresh hummus they give you to munch on before your food comes out was warm and rich in taste. We ordered a salad, this squid dish, and the moussaka as appetizers (we're pigs) and they were all superb. I got the shrimp and scallop entree that was over this thick pasta in a creamy pinkish sauce and it was amazing. My friends all got something different and they thoroughly enjoyed their dishes (the cornish hen was exceptional), until one of them found a small piece of plastic in her dish. We alerted the waiter, who brought over the manager. All we wanted to go was let him know, but he was gracious enough to offer us free drinks. After we finished our entrees, 3 beautiful desserts came out of nowhere! We told the waiter we didn't order these and the waiter told us they were compliments of the manager as an apology for the plastic we found. We were blown away by the service! All 3 desserts were incredible as well. I brought another group of friends here recently because of this amazing experience. However, the menu had changed and the dishes we ordered this time around weren't quite as good as they had been in May. My friend's salmon was dry and my other friend's shrimp dish was salty.

"This is a solid French Seafood Bistro. Do not let the location of this place fool you, its located next to the entrance of the Holland Tunnel, think of a mile-long line of honking cars trying to return to Jersey. I had a pleasant Sunday dinner with two friends at La Sirene. A couple of preliminary notes (1) This place is BYOB but there is no corkage fee (2) this place is very small - 6 tables of various sizes. FYI- There is a great table for two next to the window that would be perfect for a date that you may be able to make a special request for. I started with the Mussels in Curry Sauce. Absolutely delicious, the curry was quite mild but full of flavor, I was soaking it up with pieces of bread after making my way through the mussels which were a great way to start our meal. Next, I moved on to the French Onion Soup which was wonderfully prepared. The broth was perfect, not too salty like many other places I have been to. For the main course, I order the Butter Pan Skate Fish with Mango and Capers seasoning. It was great. The fish was very tasty and artfully prepared and presented. My friends got the Pork Tenderloin and the Seafood Sheppard's pie which they also said were great. Along with the main course, La Sirene provides a communal dish of four types of vegetables - the Carrot Puree and the Grilled Pineapple were my favorite. The pineapple was a nice complement to my skate fish. For dessert, I had a couple bites of my friend's cream puff pastry which was a nice light ending to a very filling and satisfying meal.

"Very cool place. I have walked by here 100 times and never thought about it. It's a pretty basic storefront, with little decor or hoopla, but wow, glad I went in. What makes the food quite impressive is there are no gas grills, it is all cooked in the open kitchen, in this very small room, via convection ovens.

"Went for dinner on wednesday night and the place was pretty empty (though i suppose 5:30pm is pretty early). By the time we left the tables were filled with people wining and dining. The bread basket is fantastic as are the 3 dipping sides that come with it (olive oil, an amazingly fresh butter, and an eggplant spread). The service was excellent and our waiter was able to recommend several of his favorite dishes and appetizers. friendly. Very attentive. Our water was constantly filled. While we thought the portions might end up being a bit small, they were PERFECT! the halibut entree came with not 1, but TWO square cuts of fish atop asparagus, mushrooms, potatoes, and drizzled with a lemon-creme fraiche. The creamy polenta with truffled mushrooms appetizer is a MUST!! The raspberry cheesecake sundae with salted marcona almonds and graham cracker crumbs was tasty. Good wine selection and decent cocktail menu, although I think there might be a full bar at the front where any drink concoction can be made.",5,Went for dinner on wednesday night and the place was pretty empty though i suppose 530pm is pretty early By the time we left the tables were filled with people wining and dining The bread basket is fantastic as are the 3 dipping sides that come with it olive oil an amazingly fresh butter and an eggplant spread The service was excellent and our waiter was able to recommend several of his favorite dishes and appetizers friendly Very attentive Our water was constantly filled While we thought the portions might end up being a bit small they were PERFECT the halibut entree came with not 1 but TWO square cuts of fish atop asparagus mushrooms potatoes and drizzled with a lemoncreme fraiche The creamy polenta with truffled mushrooms appetizer is a MUST The raspberry cheesecake sundae with salted marcona almonds and graham cracker crumbs was tasty Good wine selection and decent cocktail menu although I think there might be a full bar at the front where any drink concoction can be made,0
"The good: this place has amazing delicious fresh food (albeit rather small portions ... which is not the worse thing), and the interior is super cute. The bad: let's ruin all of that by playing Journey and Loverboy at an inappropriate volume at 11am on a Sunday. When we asked the owner (after having asked two waitresses to turn it down, which they did to miniscule degrees) if he could change it, he said, ""Well, but this is what we're known for!"" Really, you're known for playing loud Journey?? I would assume they would want to be know for good food, untainted by pounding hard rock music made re-famous by the hit TV show Glee. With all due respect to Juventino's culinary chops, I don't need to hear loud 80s music when I'm trying to enjoy farmstead eggs.",2,The good this place has amazing delicious fresh food albeit rather small portions which is not the worse thing and the interior is super cute The bad lets ruin all of that by playing Journey and Loverboy at an inappropriate volume at 11am on a Sunday When we asked the owner after having asked two waitresses to turn it down which they did to miniscule degrees if he could change it he said Well but this is what were known for Really youre known for playing loud Journey I would assume they would want to be know for good food untainted by pounding hard rock music made refamous by the hit TV show Glee With all due respect to Juventinos culinary chops I dont need to hear loud 80s music when Im trying to enjoy farmstead eggs,0

"Totto is one of my favorite restaurants in the city, no doubt. It never disappoints. I should thank my friends who first dragged me there four years ago on a hunt for chicken sashimi (which is no longer on the menu, but was surprisingly tasty, and more surprisingly, pleasant texturally), about which I was a skeptic. In my experience, though, Totto does chicken -- grilled, steamed, near-raw -- right. Among the base chicken yakitori options, I'm a fan of the thigh oyster. Moving beyond lonely chicken bits, the breast with shiso leaf and plum sauce is delicious, meatball-stuffed peppers are excellent, and if gizzards are your thing, well, you should try them all. I tried yesterday what I believe is a newish menu option, steamed meatball-stuffed rice balls. Nevermind that they were more of a rice-covered meatball than a meatball-stuffed rice ball; they were delicious. The tuna sashimi is very good, as are the pork offerings and beef tongue. Grilled asparagus, dry and woody, was last night's only failure. I love Totto's food, I love the atmosphere, and I'd love it if you didn't go there, so I could always have a table or a spot at the bar without a crazy wait.",5,Totto is one of my favorite restaurants in the city no doubt It never disappoints I should thank my friends who first dragged me there four years ago on a hunt for chicken sashimi which is no longer on the menu but was surprisingly tasty and more surprisingly pleasant texturally about which I was a skeptic In my experience though Totto does chicken grilled steamed nearraw right Among the base chicken yakitori options Im a fan of the thigh oyster Moving beyond lonely chicken bits the breast with shiso leaf and plum sauce is delicious meatballstuffed peppers are excellent and if gizzards are your thing well you should try them all I tried yesterday what I believe is a newish menu option steamed meatballstuffed rice balls Nevermind that they were more of a ricecovered meatball than a meatballstuffed rice ball they were delicious The tuna sashimi is very good as are the pork offerings and beef tongue Grilled asparagus dry and woody was last nights only failure I love Tottos food I love the atmosphere and Id love it if you didnt go there so I could always have a table or a spot at the bar without a crazy wait,0

"Alright after Wing L. brought me to another dumpling place not too far from this one, he brought me to this one to continue our eating mission. Took him long enough because every time we're in this area he would mention Prosperity Dumpling, but haven't had the chance to take me here until today. So this dumpling place is a hole in the wall. It did not have any fancy door front with a large seating area with tables and seats with backs. All they had was an awning, a few stools, and counter tables against the wall, which was totally fine because sometimes the greatest things comes in less attractive packaging. This place was not crowded, but it did have a few customers. The wait was not too long. The dumplings were very crispy and juicy - so juicy that it leaked down Wing's hand haha. The dumpling skin is thin, which is the way how I like dumplings done. I wished I knew about this place earlier because now I felt I've been deprived all this time eating dumplings elsewhere. And it's also $1 for 5 dumplings here!

"I am not mad at this place at all. Food wise, I did not leave as impressed as I wanted to be.. Sadly. The food looks amazing through pictures, but some of the flavors just dont match... And some of the latin cuisine classics just were regular. I was hopping that the arepa con carne was going to be amazing, but it was regular. My girlfriends salad... Regular... The coconut shrimp was really really good though, however i did notice that they have 2 go to sauces... A chipotle sauce and a Passionfruit sauce... They went great with the shrimp. Now for entrees (Yes we ate a lot of food haha) .. My girl had a ""seafood rissotto"" with shimp in that passion fruit sauce... The dish did not work one bit... And that wasnt a damn rissotto... That was saffron rice... Who you fooling? Lol. So my entree was a shrimp, octopus and heart of palm dish in a coconut tomato broth... Very hot, but delicious. The Passion fruit mojito is amazing, and the red sangria was real nice. The manager here Carlos is very hospitable and very knowledgable.

"I came to Caf Orlin after being told the wait for Clinton Street Baking Company was 2.5 hours long at 10:30AM. When I arrived at Caf Orlin at 11:30, the wait was 30 minutes. Since it got such good reviews on Yelp, I decided to wait and check it out. The waitress did a terrible job of calling out names - I was standing pretty close to her but no one in my party heard her call my name. After 45 minutes, I checked in with her, and she unapologetically said ""oops, I'll say it louder next time."" As a tip, be hypersensitive so you don't miss your turn! We got seated pretty quickly after that but were jammed into a teeny tiny space in which I couldn't move, let alone eat. It was loud, but service was quick and efficient. My friend and I both got the millet pancakes with homemade chicken-pistachio sausage. The sausage was very crumbly and a little dry, but the millet pancakes were very yummy. The beat and goat cheese salad that came with was fresh and delicious.

"This is your typical Meatpacking District restaurant. A little overpriced, mediocre food, trendy setting, decent service. Starter: Started with farmer's salad. It was extremely small. It tasted ok, was nothing special. The bread basket was very good, it's not just your standard rolls. There were rolls with meat and veggie toppings. Pastas: Came here to try the famous spaghetti. I seriously don't understand what was so special about it. It was fine, it was fresh, it was presented nicely. It was plain. Nothing to talk about. Also had the black farfalle - again, nothing special. This was slightly fishy but totally edible. What did stand out to me was the duck & foie gras ravioli. It had a wonderful flavor that just surprised me after the boring dishes I had before it. The texture was perfect. The balance of the foie gras to duck was perfect. This is definitely the dish to try here. Main: Had the pancetta wrapped pork loin. The pork loin was dry, probably because it was overcooked. Not impressed. The service was good. The hostess was friendly and offered to check in a large bag that I was carrying. She also brought me to the other members of my party who were having a drink. The waiter was attentive and gave a good recommendation on the wine. Overall, this place is just ok.

"This was my third visit to an Iron Chef restaurant (Morimoto and Flay). A party of five went to celebrate my best friend's 30th birthday and divulged in Marc Forgione's $99 tasting menu. Unlike my previous visits to Iron Chef restaurants I felt like the price of admission was worth every dollar. Enough reviews across the web cover the food (notably the Chili Lobster with Texas Toast) so I'll skip the details. I did want to note that: 1. The tasting menu offers a wide variety of food and palette cleansers. It's easy to see that Mr. Forgione put alot of time and thought into developing his outstanding tasting menu. I was especially impressed by the various palette cleansers (herbs, shot of 6 Point beer, sorbet). A small detail yes..but one that shows the effort and care that was put into designing the tasting menu 2. The service was outstanding. It took a few minutes before we received menus and water (possibly because we arrived 30 minutes before our reservation?) but after we placed our order the 7 courses were rolling out one after another. In comparrison to my previous experience with Morimoto's tasting menu there was significantly less down time in between courses. Our satisfaction with Marc Forgione's food was palpable and we left wanting to come back for more. It's safe to say that Marc Forgione's is one of the 3 best restaurants that I've ever dined at and I have no reservations in recommending it to any food enthusiast.",5,This was my third visit to an Iron Chef restaurant Morimoto and Flay A party of five went to celebrate my best friends 30th birthday and divulged in Marc Forgiones 99 tasting menu Unlike my previous visits to Iron Chef restaurants I felt like the price of admission was worth every dollar Enough reviews across the web cover the food notably the Chili Lobster with Texas Toast so Ill skip the details I did want to note that 1 The tasting menu offers a wide variety of food and palette cleansers Its easy to see that Mr Forgione put alot of time and thought into developing his outstanding tasting menu I was especially impressed by the various palette cleansers herbs shot of 6 Point beer sorbet A small detail yesbut one that shows the effort and care that was put into designing the tasting menu 2 The service was outstanding It took a few minutes before we received menus and water possibly because we arrived 30 minutes before our reservation but after we placed our order the 7 courses were rolling out one after another In comparrison to my previous experience with Morimotos tasting menu there was significantly less down time in between courses Our satisfaction with Marc Forgiones food was palpable and we left wanting to come back for more Its safe to say that Marc Forgiones is one of the 3 best restaurants that Ive ever dined at and I have no reservations in recommending it to any food enthusiast,0

"OK, so Fisher-Price isn't the same as it was when YOU were a kid. Newsflash! Neither are today's kids. I understand that people are sceptical of tie-ins with movies, but that at least is familiar to all of us. That has always been around. I think the biggest complaint for the Imaginext line for me, which I DO have, myself, is the quality for the price. The plastic is not as high quality as it should be. However, I disagree on a different point with a number of the other reviewers here. I am talking about the ""boredom factor"" mentioned. It seems to plague many of the parents or reviewers. I have one question. I do not mean to offend people, just to make them think. Take a 6 year old, for example (not a 3 year old--this toy is recommended for 36 months to age 8!!!-- unless the 36 month old in question is a card carrying member of MENSA), and try opening this WITH him or her ... and playing with it TOGETHER! It is kind of similar to learning to read a book, when you learn to play. You need guidance. Ages 4-6 (which I figure are the most appropriate for the Imaginext DC Super Friends Superman Playset) are still encompassing fairly young children. Reading to a child in that age range makes books something which will then be loved far more than if a child just looks at books by him or her self. It is the same thing with a toy like this. Don't expect a toy to be a babysitter. Play with your child when you offer your child the toy. There is lots to do with it! We like it very much. I hope you understand that I am not dissing everyone who called it boring. I am just providing a different perspective. Thanks for reading! Mom of five sons here! :) jean",4,OK so FisherPrice isnt the same as it was when YOU were a kid Newsflash Neither are todays kids I understand that people are sceptical of tieins with movies but that at least is familiar to all of us That has always been around I think the biggest complaint for the Imaginext line for me which I DO have myself is the quality for the price The plastic is not as high quality as it should be However I disagree on a different point with a number of the other reviewers here I am talking about the boredom factor mentioned It seems to plague many of the parents or reviewers I have one question I do not mean to offend people just to make them think Take a 6 year old for example not a 3 year oldthis toy is recommended for 36 months to age 8 unless the 36 month old in question is a card carrying member of MENSA and try opening this WITH him or her and playing with it TOGETHER It is kind of similar to learning to read a book when you learn to play You need guidance Ages 46 which I figure are the most appropriate for the Imaginext DC Super Friends Superman Playset are still encompassing fairly young children Reading to a child in that age range makes books something which will then be loved far more than if a child just looks at books by him or her self It is the same thing with a toy like this Dont expect a toy to be a babysitter Play with your child when you offer your child the toy There is lots to do with it We like it very much I hope you understand that I am not dissing everyone who called it boring I am just providing a different perspective Thanks for reading Mom of five sons here jean,0

"This is one of the few times amazon reviews have let me down. I bought this to have on hand whenever I made my own dressings or sauces that might be used over the course of a few days. My bottle got pushed towards the back of the cupboard and I forgot about it, until I moved and decided I should make use of it since I finally had space for everything. The first time I went to use it, however, liquid droplets went flying everywhere with the first few shakes! I thought maybe the lid wasn't tight enough, but it still leaked. I held down the flip cap, but still wound up with ingredients running down my arm. It was such a disappointing mess, and the bottle wouldn't exactly look right or be any more functional than any other bottle sans crappy screwtop that I just threw it away (a rarity for me, since I hate throwing away things.) I was pretty shocked at how useless it was since I remembered the glowing reviews my fellow Amazonians had given it, and because I have other Norpro products that are fairly above-average in terms of functionality and usefulness. The bottle's looks were pretty plain and utilitarian but I'd overlooked that for the sake of function, but now I think next time I'd prefer a prettier bottle even if it doesn't have useful features like a screw-on lid or flip top cap, since they could likely just be made of fail anyway.",2,This is one of the few times amazon reviews have let me down I bought this to have on hand whenever I made my own dressings or sauces that might be used over the course of a few days My bottle got pushed towards the back of the cupboard and I forgot about it until I moved and decided I should make use of it since I finally had space for everything The first time I went to use it however liquid droplets went flying everywhere with the first few shakes I thought maybe the lid wasnt tight enough but it still leaked I held down the flip cap but still wound up with ingredients running down my arm It was such a disappointing mess and the bottle wouldnt exactly look right or be any more functional than any other bottle sans crappy screwtop that I just threw it away a rarity for me since I hate throwing away things I was pretty shocked at how useless it was since I remembered the glowing reviews my fellow Amazonians had given it and because I have other Norpro products that are fairly aboveaverage in terms of functionality and usefulness The bottles looks were pretty plain and utilitarian but Id overlooked that for the sake of function but now I think next time Id prefer a prettier bottle even if it doesnt have useful features like a screwon lid or flip top cap since they could likely just be made of fail anyway,0
"I swear I've had the best ramen in my life, and it was at Ippudo. OK, that might sound extreme, but I promise it's really, really good here. The Akamaru Modern had such a wonderful tasting broth.

I had pork belly buns a month later at another restaurant; lets just say the Ippudo rose the bar for me. I'm pretty sure no Pork Buns can rival the ones that Ippudo makes. So good!!

"Came here upon recommendation from a friend. Like most reviewers of Verlaine have said: Lychee Martini is the highlight here. I usually order my liquor on the rocks or in shot glasses, but after tasting the lychee martini, I didn't feel so emasculated. This drink was definitely a creeper. Didn't feel a buzz until about halfway through my 4th lychee martini. Now that's a sign of a good drink. No hangover the next morning too, meaning they probably used decent vodka. Vibe was nice and the music selection set the mood, a little bit of hip -hop (ATCQ and the like), some downtempo and breakbeats. A great happy hour for anyone visiting the L.E.S.",4,Came here upon recommendation from a friend Like most reviewers of Verlaine have said Lychee Martini is the highlight here I usually order my liquor on the rocks or in shot glasses but after tasting the lychee martini I didnt feel so emasculated This drink was definitely a creeper Didnt feel a buzz until about halfway through my 4th lychee martini Now thats a sign of a good drink No hangover the next morning too meaning they probably used decent vodka Vibe was nice and the music selection set the mood a little bit of hip hop ATCQ and the like some downtempo and breakbeats A great happy hour for anyone visiting the LES,0

"The food is terrible, I gave them 2-stars only because they have good service.

The ham is definitely not Italian ham, it's like refrigerated cooked ham that I can get from a regular supermarket. This place is definitely overpriced. The dishes are also very Americanized.

Also, I never would have found this place without Yelp so I need to pay it forward. I was looking for a moderately priced restaurant with good reviews for food and service in the Chelsea area for my birthday and stumbled upon the Yelp reviews for Porteno. True to the reviews, the food and service was superb and I'm so happy I found this gem for my birthday dinner! My girlfriend, mother, and I shared the pate and octupus salad for appetizers and we were not disappointed. Our server, Natalia, was funny, attentive, and sweet and paired us with a Malbec bottle of wine that was just right for us and didn't break the bank. I had the filet mignon entree, while my mother had the chuleta (porkchop) and my girlfriend had the risotto. My entree was cooked to perfection and my mother had a large, succulent cut of pork chop. My girlfriend enjoyed her risotto but felt it might have benefitted from a little more moistness and cheese. The real gem was the service we received at the restaurant. We were made to feel at home and even kissed Natalia goodbye when we were leaving. I left with a satisfied smile on my face and the perfect birthday night out.

"I had a chance to sample the food at Num Pang while on a business meeting last week. I was very impressed with how delicious the food was. The flavors are very distinct, and very pleasing, but not overwhelming. The size of the food was just right. I had the mackerel sandwich which was out of this world, the red curry lentil soup, also very flavorful, and the blood orange lemonade which was very refreshing. I highly recommend trying this place.",5,I had a chance to sample the food at Num Pang while on a business meeting last week I was very impressed with how delicious the food was The flavors are very distinct and very pleasing but not overwhelming The size of the food was just right I had the mackerel sandwich which was out of this world the red curry lentil soup also very flavorful and the blood orange lemonade which was very refreshing I highly recommend trying this place,1

"It's been a theme between my friends and I, that if you're unemployed or in between jobs, THIS is the time to go to Totto Ramen. Get there around 11:45am on a weekday, write your name on that clipboard and get in 15 min later when they open for fresh ramen. You would think that in 90 degree weather, new yorkers would avoid a hot bowl of ramen in this cruel cruel humid weather, but no. I think that newyorkers are thinking what everyone else is thinking - ""it's a hot day so the lines must be shorter!"" To me, the noodles are above average, but the broth is heaven.

"We just had one of the best dining experiences, ever, at Hearth. We chose to indulge in the tasting menu with wine pairings as recommended by the extraordinarily knowledgeable staff. The food was of course amazing, given the farm-fresh and local sourcing approach. And the staff!! Knowledgeable is an understatement. Our wines were described in cinematic detail by The Server from Greenpoint, and everything else first-class from the open-hand table setting to the friendly patient, accommodating and ultra-professional staff. I can't wait to go back & try everything else on the menu!

"My girlfriend and some friends and I went to Sake Bar Hagi because word on the street is that it is authentic Japanese food. My girlfriend is Japanese (Osaka) and I have been there twice. I can say from my experience at this restaurant that it is not authentic. It just feels acceptable at the end because it's actually pretty cheap. That is probrably the best thing about Sake Bar Hagi. Okonomiyaki and Takoyaki are street foods from Osaka, which I have eaten there. My girlfriend and I both agreed that they made the okonomiyaki all wrong and the takoyaki seemed like it was frozen. Okonomiyaki is suppose to have cabbage in it! Also, the ramen was quite strange! Strange white cream coloring and too salty! The yakitori was under seasoned and the meat quality was poor.

"A pleasant experience indeed. My guy friend and I came here for the first time and was pretty excited as this place has great reviews! I love ramen and wanted to come here when Ramen King came to town but missed out. Either way, I knew I had to come for a taste to see what everyone is raving about. First off, the wait for this place is ridiculously long! We waited for over an hour before being seated, and this was on a Monday night! Imagine if we had came on a weekend, whew! Once seated, we were greeted by our server and beverages quickly came out. We ordered the Pork Hirata Buns which were DEliciousss. Amazing flavors, I wanted more! We also ordered Hirata Chicken Wings. They were also very tasty but I would take the buns over this any day! Salivating as I recall the taste :D As for the ramen, I chose the Shiromaru Hakata Classic while my friend had the Karaka Men. I love spicy food but was sick so I chose not to have anything spicy. I was more than happy with my pick as it was soooo scrumptiously good. I really love food and this place is probably one of my favorites now. Although a bit pricy but to me, they were worth every penny...oh and even the long wait! ^_~; Ippudo, you will be seeing me again :D",5,A pleasant experience indeed My guy friend and I came here for the first time and was pretty excited as this place has great reviews I love ramen and wanted to come here when Ramen King came to town but missed out Either way I knew I had to come for a taste to see what everyone is raving about First off the wait for this place is ridiculously long We waited for over an hour before being seated and this was on a Monday night Imagine if we had came on a weekend whew Once seated we were greeted by our server and beverages quickly came out We ordered the Pork Hirata Buns which were DEliciousss Amazing flavors I wanted more We also ordered Hirata Chicken Wings They were also very tasty but I would take the buns over this any day Salivating as I recall the taste D As for the ramen I chose the Shiromaru Hakata Classic while my friend had the Karaka Men I love spicy food but was sick so I chose not to have anything spicy I was more than happy with my pick as it was soooo scrumptiously good I really love food and this place is probably one of my favorites now Although a bit pricy but to me they were worth every pennyoh and even the long wait Ippudo you will be seeing me again D,0

"Wow, I've found the best New York pizza! Word of caution: arriving 20 minutes before the place opens will only get you 40 people away from the door. Yes, the line gets long before the place even opens. Given the choice between deep dish pizza like the one found in Chicago or New York style pizza, I'd definitely choose the latter. It worked out well that I got to experience this awesome pizza joint. On my first trip to the Big Apple, our group made sure to include Grimaldi's on the list of destinations. We lined up as if we were at Disneyland, 20 minutes before opening hour. After getting to the front of the line and getting our table and getting situated, we hungrily ordered two large pizzas. When it was ready, the pizzas came thin, crispy, and right from the oven!! Each bite was soooo GOOD!

"This is a perfect date or friend-date spot. I went here around 6:30 on a Sunday night for dinner. We were able to get a spot in the back garden. Even at this early hour, around 75-85% of the tables were taken in the back patio. The back garden is truly lovely. It's one of those rare spaces that make you forget you are in the city -- and the food helps with the illusion as well. Everything is so light and fresh. To start, I ordered the peas, fennel, mint, sour cherries and broccoli rabe. It was crisp and bright, though the portion could have been a tad larger. My friend ordered the flatbread, herbed ricotta and and tomatoes. Very good. For our main meal we both ordered the barley risotto. Buttery but light. The least guilt-inducing risotto ever.",4,This is a perfect date or frienddate spot I went here around 630 on a Sunday night for dinner We were able to get a spot in the back garden Even at this early hour around 7585 of the tables were taken in the back patio The back garden is truly lovely Its one of those rare spaces that make you forget you are in the city and the food helps with the illusion as well Everything is so light and fresh To start I ordered the peas fennel mint sour cherries and broccoli rabe It was crisp and bright though the portion could have been a tad larger My friend ordered the flatbread herbed ricotta and and tomatoes Very good For our main meal we both ordered the barley risotto Buttery but light The least guiltinducing risotto ever,0

"What is this sensation in my mouth? It is Bo Ky's soup! I thought of coming here with my girlfriend after noticing how it is a pho house that has a different look compared to the typical vietnamese restaurants.

I automatically knew I wanted a beef pho and that is what I ordered and wow. The soup was really addicting and mentally I refuse to believe it is drugged.

"After a day of shopping with friends we stopped in for a quick bite and drinks. What a great little bistro! The staff were very accommodating of our party of five.... very courteous and attentive. The owner even came over to make sure we were comfortable and had everything we needed. Each of our meals were delicious. Some of us ordered ""bistro classics"" while others really enjoyed some more modern/creative dishes. Needless to say, we ended up eating off of each other's plates. The waitress noticed what we were doing and instead of being frowned upon she actually brought us extra plates and silverware -- so nice. I can't wait to go back with my husband and will definitely tell my friends and colleagues about this hidden gem! After having such a pleasurable experience at Bistro Les Amis I had to write a review and ended up reading through some of the others written before me, most all of which were positive and complimentary. I have to say that I'm a bit confused and taken aback by the review left by H.G. of Montauk. It seems to be such an angry, personal attack rather than a review of his or her dining experience.

"Eataly - The IKEA of Italian food. That's not a bad thing... just an observation. It's big, loaded with stuff to buy, and equally loaded with people who might not be buying, but entertained by the journey from the front door to the cashier area/exit. Everything looks great, and there are multiple places to sit and eat, but it's also so big that it's tough to decide where to plant one's flag. Mixing retail with multiple restaurants is tricky. Probably the best strategy is to visit with a ""no buy"" rule, so you see everything, then circle back in. Then you'll know where to grab a coffee/pizza/gelato, or where to grab some olive oil or Balsamic to go.",3,Eataly The IKEA of Italian food Thats not a bad thing just an observation Its big loaded with stuff to buy and equally loaded with people who might not be buying but entertained by the journey from the front door to the cashier areaexit Everything looks great and there are multiple places to sit and eat but its also so big that its tough to decide where to plant ones flag Mixing retail with multiple restaurants is tricky Probably the best strategy is to visit with a no buy rule so you see everything then circle back in Then youll know where to grab a coffeepizzagelato or where to grab some olive oil or Balsamic to go,0

We also had this pappardelle with pancetta and cremini mushroom, which also good, but not as awesome as the bucatini. We ended the meal with the steak, which had this spicy sauce with fresh green, yellow and red peppers. It was good, but not that impressive.

"There are perhaps 2 schools of thought when it comes to the process of eating: 1. Those who slowly savor each and every tiny little bite. 2. Those who try to jam as much food into their mouth as possible so that their tastebuds are overwhelmed with flavor. (This is also, coincidentally, a similar trait to that found in crack addicts) I am definitely of the latter school (uhh... not the crack addict part of course *cough cough*). People often find it embarrassing to sit next to me at a meal... especially at a nice restaurant. So with that context in mind, let me just say that any meal that can take 3 hrs and not have me feel impatient or bored in between, is a meal deserving of 5 stars. That meal, was the tasting menu at Dover. 7 courses... SEVEN! With like a million little things in between! It is definitely a good value for the price, the time and the quality. Pictures tell a thousand words, but the standout dishes for me were the scallops and the lamb (a substitute that the staff graciously made). I'm glad that this extension of Battersby is living up to the reputation of its beginnings. It may not have the same intimate atmosphere, but the friendliness of the staff, and the care with which you are served, are impeccable. The meal was perfectly paced, and it felt like something special.

"Came here for brunch after reading positive reviews, and it was just ok. The apps were the best part of the meal, by far, with the scallops being pleasantly light, and tasty. The calamari was also quite good. Their mimosas were almost entirely OJ, and at $14 a piece was beyond a bummer. The entrees we had were not great. I had a spinach goat cheese omelet, which was cold, rubbery, and strange. My friend had the scrambled eggs which were very runny. However our 3rd friend had a turkey sandwich which was really good. OH we also shared the maple bacon biscuits, which were tasty, but at $10 for 2 biscuits, it's also not really worth it.

"Damn near perfect. Really cozy and inviting atmosphere, especially on cold and windy Greenpoint nights, and friendly staff, even when putting up with impatient and hungry masses. Oh, and wholly satisfying pizza that makes you feel 1000%. Yes, there can be long wait times, but lines move fast and the staff are rarely rude, in my experience. And there are tons of great bars nearby to have a couple drinks while you wait. I used to live in Greenpoint and this is one of the places I miss the most.",5,Damn near perfect Really cozy and inviting atmosphere especially on cold and windy Greenpoint nights and friendly staff even when putting up with impatient and hungry masses Oh and wholly satisfying pizza that makes you feel 1000 Yes there can be long wait times but lines move fast and the staff are rarely rude in my experience And there are tons of great bars nearby to have a couple drinks while you wait I used to live in Greenpoint and this is one of the places I miss the most,0
"Bland! If this is Puerto Rican food, then the cook needs to get some lessons from a real Puerto Rican that knows how to cook. The rice & beans were practically flavorless and the rice was over cooked. The 1/4 chicken breast was D...R...Y...DRY!!! and had no seasoning at all! This place almost makes me embarrassed to be Puerto Rican! Both of my grandmothers were excellent cooks and their food would run circles around La Taza de Oro. It really should be called La Taza de Mierda. Because thats what the food there is....sh!t!!!

Dumplings are great! Dough is well prepared and the stuffing is full and tasty! Seasame Pancake sandwich with beef is my favorite! The beef is the best I've ever had in these 5 years away from home!

"Heard about this place from almost everyone I have met in Brooklyn. The pizza was incredible. Light brick oven pizza, but the medley of different tastes were delicious. The sausage pizza was incredible and the mozzarella cheese on top made it even better. Definitely authentic brooklyn-style pizza. Only negative part of Grimaldi's was the service. Only got water once during our meal and it took forever to get the check. It was busy, but still, water is vital with hot pizza and spices. I will give them the benefit of the doubt and I will definitely go back.",4,Heard about this place from almost everyone I have met in Brooklyn The pizza was incredible Light brick oven pizza but the medley of different tastes were delicious The sausage pizza was incredible and the mozzarella cheese on top made it even better Definitely authentic brooklynstyle pizza Only negative part of Grimaldis was the service Only got water once during our meal and it took forever to get the check It was busy but still water is vital with hot pizza and spices I will give them the benefit of the doubt and I will definitely go back,0

"Seriously, who doesn't LOVE NYC pizza? I am not a Chicago girl, so deep dish does NOT do it for me...thin, brick oven (coal oven to be sure) definitely makes my mouth water! My friend Sarah took me on a tour of food when I visited NYC this past summer and her number one priority was getting me to Lombardi's where we could get in and out before the crowd hit. They don't take reservations, but they open fairly early. There was no one around us when we first sat down but by the time we left, the wait was an hour long! We got a pepperoni/sausage pizza and a pitcher of Coke (who does that anymore?!). It was fantastic. Our server was great, attentive and we all shared a salad while we waited for our pizza. Once it arrived, conversation halted as we indulged in a truly delectable experience. For my first time in NYC, I have to say this is DEFINITELY a must do, but it doesn't matter how many times I go back, I'll have to check out Lombardi's every time. If you don't enjoy this place, then you have your head placed firmly up your own ass. :) WONDEEEERRFFFULLLL!!

"Paprika is a wonderful little gem hidden in the E. Village. I had wanted to find a cozy but inexpensive restaurant where I could catch up with friends including a visitor from out of town. It was perfect for the occasion. I highly recommend ordering the beef carpaccio with arugula, truffle oil and parmigiano to share as appetizer. We all ordered pasta and everyone enjoyed their dishes. Such good pasta for less than $20! I got the creamy lobster maccheroni and cheese. It tastes almost exactly like lobster bisque with pasta. The creamy taste does get tiring after awhile so maybe share with a friend. Portions are huge to boot.",4,Paprika is a wonderful little gem hidden in the E Village I had wanted to find a cozy but inexpensive restaurant where I could catch up with friends including a visitor from out of town It was perfect for the occasion I highly recommend ordering the beef carpaccio with arugula truffle oil and parmigiano to share as appetizer We all ordered pasta and everyone enjoyed their dishes Such good pasta for less than 20 I got the creamy lobster maccheroni and cheese It tastes almost exactly like lobster bisque with pasta The creamy taste does get tiring after awhile so maybe share with a friend Portions are huge to boot,0
I was really worried about this because I thought it would be a nice addition to the litter box. I had to replace the cat litter with the plastic one.

"My boyfriend and I came here about half an hour before closing time. We had a late night craving for tacos as usual and this place was opened late and relatively close. We ordered the chicken mole and four tacos: two leungua, barbocoa, chicken. The guacamole was amazing but you have to add a bit salt into it. The tacos were smaller than I expected but still tasty! Chicken mole was a no for me, the mole was a little too sweet and it didn't mix well with the rice.

"I live a few blocks away and have been here twice. The first time was very close to the time they opened, when they were still byob and in the process of getting their beer/wine license. I recall the fish tacos being good and the roo sliders also being decent. The lamb lollies entree was also good, though a relatively small portion at the $20+ price point. At the time, they were out of pavlova which was a disappointment. Flash forward perhaps 6 months later, the place always looks busy when I'm walking down Ditmars. I thought let's give it another try. Unfortunately they were out of kangaroo at 8pm on a Saturday. I don't get it, but I'm always overhearing that this place runs out of stuff all the time. So we went with the calamari and steak tacos, and I think we had the chicken sliders as well. After the calamari came out, the rest of our meal took over 30+ minutes to arrive. I recall the meat on the sliders being so thin that it mainly consisted of just bread. The calamari is some of the worst I've ever had. I could give a damn if the breading is gluten free - it tastes horrible. The steak in our tacos was also very overcooked, chewy, and basically just loaded with dry red cabbage. The wine selection is actually very decent and the only bright spot of the meal.",2,I live a few blocks away and have been here twice The first time was very close to the time they opened when they were still byob and in the process of getting their beerwine license I recall the fish tacos being good and the roo sliders also being decent The lamb lollies entree was also good though a relatively small portion at the 20 price point At the time they were out of pavlova which was a disappointment Flash forward perhaps 6 months later the place always looks busy when Im walking down Ditmars I thought lets give it another try Unfortunately they were out of kangaroo at 8pm on a Saturday I dont get it but Im always overhearing that this place runs out of stuff all the time So we went with the calamari and steak tacos and I think we had the chicken sliders as well After the calamari came out the rest of our meal took over 30 minutes to arrive I recall the meat on the sliders being so thin that it mainly consisted of just bread The calamari is some of the worst Ive ever had I could give a damn if the breading is gluten free it tastes horrible The steak in our tacos was also very overcooked chewy and basically just loaded with dry red cabbage The wine selection is actually very decent and the only bright spot of the meal,0
"More of a 3.5, but I'm leaning toward 4 because the majority of my experiences here have been great. The bummer is that it's not consistent.. i.e. sometimes food will taste worse than the usual. Overall, it is a solid spot with huge portions and very reasonable prices. Things that bother me: -Sometimes the service from hostesses and waitpeople can be rude and/or lacking (but again, sometimes it is really good) -More than once I have received smelly drinking glasses (like I can smell whatever the last person was eating on the glass.. ew. I do have an extremely sensitive nose), and unclean utensils -The last time I ordered an omelette the thing was DRENCHED in oil. It was disgusting and I could not finish it... the thing left an oil puddle on my plate. It was very gross. Also, I thought I detected butter in the home fries. I don't know if my tastebuds were deceiving me, but I think they should disclose if butter is used, because some of us want to avoid eating too much fat. I've ordered the omelette before and have never tasted butter or had it be so oily. This is the problem I have with this place, it's not consistent. -Really, really, REALLY bad music. The last two times I visited they played nonstop country and Nickelback, respectively. Who is making your playlist, Jacob's Pickles? My friends and I literally hurried our meal because the music was unbearable. If service was always good and the food always consistent, this would be close to a 5 star experience, because when it is good, it is a very nice spot to eat in the food desert that is the UWS.",4,More of a 35 but Im leaning toward 4 because the majority of my experiences here have been great The bummer is that its not consistent ie sometimes food will taste worse than the usual Overall it is a solid spot with huge portions and very reasonable prices Things that bother me Sometimes the service from hostesses and waitpeople can be rude andor lacking but again sometimes it is really good More than once I have received smelly drinking glasses like I can smell whatever the last person was eating on the glass ew I do have an extremely sensitive nose and unclean utensils The last time I ordered an omelette the thing was DRENCHED in oil It was disgusting and I could not finish it the thing left an oil puddle on my plate It was very gross Also I thought I detected butter in the home fries I dont know if my tastebuds were deceiving me but I think they should disclose if butter is used because some of us want to avoid eating too much fat Ive ordered the omelette before and have never tasted butter or had it be so oily This is the problem I have with this place its not consistent Really really REALLY bad music The last two times I visited they played nonstop country and Nickelback respectively Who is making your playlist Jacobs Pickles My friends and I literally hurried our meal because the music was unbearable If service was always good and the food always consistent this would be close to a 5 star experience because when it is good it is a very nice spot to eat in the food desert that is the UWS,0
"Food was fantastic, as usual, but service (not sure one can call this 'service' at that point) was at a snail's pace. I had made reservations for my birthday two weeks before. We were 14 people and arrived on time. They told us that people on our table were about to pay - apparently that didn't happen for a good 50min. Instead of having us go someplace else for a drink and coming back for dinner, they kept coming back saying it was only gonna be another 10min. They let all of us STAND outside and wait, and the manager himself told us they would bring out the food very quickly to make up for it. I wasn't too thrilled about a rushed dinner, but should have insisted on that...the waitress could not have been SLOWER, it was so frustrating. We had reservations at a bar later on and paid for it, almost lost our res, plus more people were gonna join us. Everything got delayed by 1.5hrs(!!) - had we not been that many people, we would have left. They were obviously aware that some sort of compensation was appropriate, so they brought out two or three appetizers, which was nice but come on... First round of drinks would have been appropriate. It was the only one anyway, since we didn't have time for more anymore.. In a nutshell: OUTSTANDING food at a great venue, but one of the worst services I've ever experienced in the city (on my bday!), and a rather mingy compensation for a 50min wait.

"Gumbo. That is what has earned this place four stars. Their gumbo is spot on to some of the best stuff you will find in New Orleans. The rue isn't too dark and it is FULL of seafood, sausage, chicken and okra. It is a tad bit on the pricey side at $18 bucks a bowl, but you will leave rather satisfied. I even used the side of bread that came with it to wipe my bowl clean (as opposed to picking it up and licking it, which was a temptation). I also sampled my dates burger and it was rather tasty as well. I didn't care much for the bun they put it on, but the meat and bacon were cooked perfectly to order and the toppings were a good compliment to the flavor of the meat. The fries were also good, but they cost an extra couple of bucks to get. Yeah, wtf. A burger that doesn't come with fries... seems almost impossible to fathom. I am realizing that this is not the most exciting review I have written, but that may be because this place doesn't provoke much excitement for me except for their gumbo.

I've been here *two times*. I strongly recommend the shrimp and calamari. They season the shrimp very well and they have a little special sauce that is so delicious! I loved it backyard it's very peaceful! They put a fan which I really appreciate... and there is stones everywhere...the first time it was perfect...the second time the neighbors next door were doing construction it was very loud. The actual lobster roll is not my fav. The first time i had it ...it was a lunch special and they put coleslaw on it and I hate coldslaw. I thought that was very odd. But honestly its about preference maybe you like coleslaw. Other than that it's very delicious.

"The brunch is unbelievably amazing. I don't know why it took me so long to have it but like the dinner here, you want to do things right. This isn't your basic brunch. This is another level so I strongly recommend at least 2 courses. Start with a warm beverage and a cocktail because you are at brunch. Enjoy yourself. Then order a nice savory meal but don't forget that you could start that meal with a sticky bun or you could end it with Pecan Pie French Toast. I chose the later and I am so happy that I did. This is like no other french toast in the world. It is so custardy and yummy then you get to the end an you are just trying to scrape up every last bite of that mapley-pecan goodness with the flaky croissant-crust. You will love every last bite.",5,The brunch is unbelievably amazing I dont know why it took me so long to have it but like the dinner here you want to do things right This isnt your basic brunch This is another level so I strongly recommend at least 2 courses Start with a warm beverage and a cocktail because you are at brunch Enjoy yourself Then order a nice savory meal but dont forget that you could start that meal with a sticky bun or you could end it with Pecan Pie French Toast I chose the later and I am so happy that I did This is like no other french toast in the world It is so custardy and yummy then you get to the end an you are just trying to scrape up every last bite of that mapleypecan goodness with the flaky croissantcrust You will love every last bite,0
"The intrepid eater and I had a lovely lunch at Nyonya today. We ordered ginger duck which had a lot of ginger and a lot of duck in a very tasty brown sauce with scallions. We practically licked the platter clean. The Shanghai noodles were ok. they were fresh, but a little chewy and did not have a lot of garnishes. The appetizer pancakes are a better bet for carbs. ( next time.) For dessert we shared yams in coconut milk. It was gently sweet, and just enough. I think I like the sticky rice with coconut here better. The tea was very good and they happily provided a second pot. The service is friendly and professional. The place is large, bustling, filled with happy diners. Surprisingly the noise level is not bad.

"I suspect that the food was delicious when it was originally cooked; however they did such a terrible job packing the food that it was ruined in the short time it took to deliver it to me. I order profiteroles for our dessert. This has whipped cream in it. It was packed with hot food so all that was left of the cream was a liquid mess at the bottom of the container. The sandwich was rattled around so much that it came undone. Finally, and perhaps the worst of all was the hot coffee drink was spilled all over the bag. I lifted off the lid and 2/3rds of the drink were gone. I really should have called and complained but we were so hungry that we ate what we could and threw the rest away. A real shame. In person, the food is delicious but they were so careless with the delivery service that I would have to rethink if I want to go back -- even in person.",2,I suspect that the food was delicious when it was originally cooked however they did such a terrible job packing the food that it was ruined in the short time it took to deliver it to me I order profiteroles for our dessert This has whipped cream in it It was packed with hot food so all that was left of the cream was a liquid mess at the bottom of the container The sandwich was rattled around so much that it came undone Finally and perhaps the worst of all was the hot coffee drink was spilled all over the bag I lifted off the lid and 23rds of the drink were gone I really should have called and complained but we were so hungry that we ate what we could and threw the rest away A real shame In person the food is delicious but they were so careless with the delivery service that I would have to rethink if I want to go back even in person,0

"here at minetta tavern good food is matched with a great atmosphere. good ole eddie minetta decorated it up nice, and the present owners have kept the paraphernalia up, including hundreds of caricatures and old photos. while atmosphere is all well and good, it really comes down to the food, doesn't it. especially when we're looking at those 3 dollar signs. minetta delivers. thoughtful dishes, such as the lobster salad, a tartar plate of beef, lamb, and veal, prepare a person for great things to come. those great things comes in the form of the cote de beouf. now i'm not an extravagant person, but if i'm gonna eat at an expensive restaurant, i'm gonna do it right. you've got to get this steak. the moment the waiter brings it out for you to admire, the perfectly cooked hunk of meat looks you dead in the eye and says, 'i'm worth it.' it may not have actually spoken to me, but its fragrance did the talking. it was then taken away, then cut for us, with two marrow packed bones. from that dish, you realize that richness is the name of the game here at minetta, and they do it up right. in addition, the serving seems quite flawless, even if some ass (notably me) decides to tip his glass over on the table, or a jerk (also me) pushes a water glass onto the floor. they were on it in a second, and polite about it. the one drawback is the size of the dining room. any place that you have to move a table out to sit down is small. that said, once i was there it wasn't half bad... just don't get between me an my cote de boeuf.",4,here at minetta tavern good food is matched with a great atmosphere good ole eddie minetta decorated it up nice and the present owners have kept the paraphernalia up including hundreds of caricatures and old photos while atmosphere is all well and good it really comes down to the food doesnt it especially when were looking at those 3 dollar signs minetta delivers thoughtful dishes such as the lobster salad a tartar plate of beef lamb and veal prepare a person for great things to come those great things comes in the form of the cote de beouf now im not an extravagant person but if im gonna eat at an expensive restaurant im gonna do it right youve got to get this steak the moment the waiter brings it out for you to admire the perfectly cooked hunk of meat looks you dead in the eye and says im worth it it may not have actually spoken to me but its fragrance did the talking it was then taken away then cut for us with two marrow packed bones from that dish you realize that richness is the name of the game here at minetta and they do it up right in addition the serving seems quite flawless even if some ass notably me decides to tip his glass over on the table or a jerk also me pushes a water glass onto the floor they were on it in a second and polite about it the one drawback is the size of the dining room any place that you have to move a table out to sit down is small that said once i was there it wasnt half bad just dont get between me an my cote de boeuf,0
"Why every time I start really liking a place they raise their prices? Yeah, it's only maybe .50-$1.00 per item, but I'd already considered it a bit pricey for what it was so now it's a bit over the top for me. Which means I'll prob be coming here like 80% less (like only when I have friends in town who want to come here instead of 2 or 3 times a week,) so at least in my case they're losing $ by raising prices, not making more of a profit.

"This is a small restaurant with just a few tables and the menu is very limited. I had the red lentil soup, mix platter, turkish tea, turkish coffee, almond pudding and baklava. The soup is creamy and sour. It was ok. The mix platter consist of grilled meatball, meatball with cheese, chicken, and lamb sausage with a little bit of salad. I like that the salad was tossed in dressing. The mix platter of various meats was delicious. The Turkish tea was nothing special, tasteless, and the cup was tiny. The Turkish coffee is served in this very cool looking cup and it is very tiny as well. The coffee was very bitter, not a fan. The almond pudding was my favorite and the baklava was disappointing.

"I can't remember when/where I heard about Extra Virgin. I want to say it was in one of those super annoying screens during a non-eventful cab ride. However, boy am I glad I remembered how deliciously pretty the plates were presented on screen. I went on a date last Friday around 8pm. The place already had a nice waiting list going on. The host quickly jumped at us and said it would be at least 45 minutes, which we were more than ready to wait. The ambiance is very cozy and romantic, so we didn't mind. I did not care for the shortness of the host though... he wasn't very pleasant and seemed bothered to have yet one more couple to deal with. ehh.. we sat at the bar for probably 20 mins and not even half way through my glass of wine, we were seated. My date devoured his salmon dish and I ordered the seafood stew, which was the special of the day. The stew was excellent comfort food, pretty hearty with a nice kick of spice.

"I heard too many great things about this place and I HAVE TO TRY IT!!! La Sirene came to be the top French restaurant here other than Balthazar.. I am so glad they take reservations and 8.30pm on a Friday night is not a problem.. Getting out from the subway station and I was way too confused with all the road at the west side.. Thanks to I phone.. alright.. enough of my story and I will go straight to my review.. Starting off with 2 appetizer.. 1) the octopus 2) the mussels (chef recommendation).. The octopus was baked with some greens and mushrooms which made it awesome.. I always love french food because it wasn't that filling and yet good enough to enjoy! and as for the mussels.. There are apples in it which made it slightly different.. The mussels were so fresh.. I think I can see myself keep eating it and will not get sick of it.. The soup goes really nice with the complimentary bread they served.. I was kinda full after appetizer.. Thank goodness the entree wasn't that big.. We ordered the specialty (I think it's tilapia.) and duck breast with red wine sauce.. This is probably the best duck breast that was cooked in medium rare, and yet I LOVE IT!!! I usually love my food to be medium well to well done.. just because I feel like eating raw meat kinda gross me out.. but since the chef recommend it medium rare.. I will just go with it.. As for the tilapia.. It's also really fresh and flavorful.. not too salty like most of the restaurants.. Desserts... There's always room for it.. So we ordered the chocolate lava which takes 12 minutes to baked it.. came with home made cream, home-made coconut ice-cream, home-made jam.. I asked something really silly to the waitress.. ""EVERYTHING HOMEMAD??"".. she goes like ""yes... everything was made by us"".. I guess this is what makes La Sirene so special because it's located slightly further from the tourist spot.. It's more cozy and it's not that noisy.. Oh.. The chocolate lava is always good.. It's BYOB.. so bring a bottle of wine to enjoy with your food!!!

"Yuck! Why does everyone love this place??? Granted the vibe is lively and the service was good, but the food was awful. I ordered the bacon wrapped apricots, gross. The mussels, really, really gross. There was something crunchy in them (sand, shells?) and black spots in the mussel (don't want to think about what that could have been). I didn't drink, so can't comment on those. I tried the chips with blue cheese (someone else at my table ordered), which were not anything special.

"What I was looking for was old school, hearty, unpretentious Italian food. That is what I found, and that is what they serve here. The service was great too, and from the moment I walked in, I felt welcome and that my business was appreciated (even as a casually dressed solo diner at the bar). I started with a nice glass of reasonably priced Italian wine and some nice bread. I had sort of a standard vinagrette salad with crisp, fresh greens. For my main, i had the squid ink pasta (with seafood). It is pretty similar to what most other places call ""frutti di mare,"" but a very good version. The pasta was fresh and perfectly cooked, the sauce was light (but not watery or bland), and there was smorgasbord of very fresh, large shellfish. It is a large plate of delicious food.",5,What I was looking for was old school hearty unpretentious Italian food That is what I found and that is what they serve here The service was great too and from the moment I walked in I felt welcome and that my business was appreciated even as a casually dressed solo diner at the bar I started with a nice glass of reasonably priced Italian wine and some nice bread I had sort of a standard vinagrette salad with crisp fresh greens For my main i had the squid ink pasta with seafood It is pretty similar to what most other places call frutti di mare but a very good version The pasta was fresh and perfectly cooked the sauce was light but not watery or bland and there was smorgasbord of very fresh large shellfish It is a large plate of delicious food,0

"Great place to go if you are in a large group. You order and pay at the register and they bring your food to your table. If you have a large party, everyone can order separately and eat/drink without having to worry about splitting bills or some people needing to leave earlier than other. Food and service were both good when I went for a friends engagement party.

"This was my first time going on a trip with the boyfriend's parents & we ended up in Chinatown during lunch time. Now, I am hesitant about eating in Chinatown, especially if it looks kind of shabby & dirty (bad prior experiences); but out of respect, I sat dow in my chair & ordered my meal. I got the Roast pork, chicken, fried egg & rice. The chicken was tender but I got BBQ pork (the red/orange kind) instead of roast pork (the brown kind with crispy skin). The boyfriend's mom got a Beef brisket & tendon noodle soup which had no tendon. His dad got BBQ spareribs ""lo mein"" which was very small & really cold. when I was eating, the table of French tourists next to us were getting ready to leave & they left $0.25 tip on the table (what cheapo's but hey, their prerogative right?). When the waitress saw this, she came over & said to the family that each table has a $6 ""service fee"". This was a total lie because this ""policy"" was not listed anywhere; not on walls, not on the tables, & not in the menu. After this table, I noticed that this trick was also done to other non-Chinese or non-American customers. Wanting to avoid this, we put down the exact amount (with tip) in cash & walked out before any waiter/waitress came by.

"Totto Ramen serves up some of the best Ramen i've ever had. I'm no ramen expert but I've tried ramen places in SF and in LA and Totto is up there with some of the best. I had the Miso with pork, which was AWESOME. Miso broth was flavorful but not too salty. Pork had a perfect char on the outside, but it melted in my mouth and had a great flavor. Noodles were cooked perfectly and all the other garnishes blended well together to create a tasty bowl of ramen. The only knock on this place is the wait. Because this place is really small, the wait can take awhile. I suggest getting there as early as possible. They opened at 11am, I got there at about 11:20am and there was still about a 20-30 min wait. They also don't take parties larger than 4 because the biggest table they have only fits 4.

"What a lovely place! I'd meant to visit it for some time, oftenseeing its many accolades in print and on the web. Holiday shopping in SoHo finally brought me and the SO to their Tapas Shop--a pretty neat quick lunch, perfect for our timeline. We went with bocadillos: delicious sandwiches on ciabatta with to-die-for Spanish cold cuts--cured/salted meats, cheeses, etc. Mine was toasted but I could easily tear into a cold one with gusto. I had one of the meat versions and SO went for a tortilla (potato omelet). Yum, to both! Another treat was the generous selection of Spanish artisanal beers (you rarely see those three words together, at least in the U.S.). We washed down the sandwiches with a delicious farmhouse ale--on the pricey side, but worth the experience. There are several beers and wines on offer, so you'll find something to your liking. Of course, there is also the gourmet food shop. I wasn't planning on buying anything, but we did walk out with some Spanish truffles intended to stuff some family stockings.

"After looking forward to gong to Scarpetta with my parents for months, I am pleased to say that it lived up to every expectation I had. We were off to a rough start when they told me it would be an hour & a half wait, but it really wasn't. Once we were seated, everything was superb. First shout out goes to the eggplant caponata served with the bread. Can I take a jar of this home please? So delicious. The olive oil was also light, lemony and amazing. Second shout out is to the water pitchers. They're beautiful and I want one of those to take home too. For appetizers we had the creamy polenta with mushroom sauce which was rich and intensely creamy. I loved the mushroom sauce, and I don't usually like mushrooms. We also shared the fried mozzarella with stewed baby tomatoes - the cheese was good but the stewed tomato sauce was what really made this dish. I got the duck foi gras ravioli - they were amazing! Little pillows of deliciousness in a thin cream sauce. Again, very rich, so I was glad that the family wanted to share around because I might not have been able to finish the whole plate (OK yes I would have, but I might have regretted it later). BF had the pasta with asparagus and corn which was the polar opposite to my pasta - light, crunchy and summery. We were a little nervous about the corn but it was a winner. Mom had the Sicilian duck, which was cooked in a way that made it more like a red meat than a poultry. It was really unique, and very enjoyable. Dad had the black cod with fennel which was also an interesting combination done perfectly. For dessert we got the amedei chocolate cake which was wonderful but once again, incredibly rich. We also shared a peach shortbread with ice cream dessert which was sweet and delicious. Loved them both. All in all, wonderful experience. Can't wait to go back - but I'll be making a reservation next time.",5,After looking forward to gong to Scarpetta with my parents for months I am pleased to say that it lived up to every expectation I had We were off to a rough start when they told me it would be an hour a half wait but it really wasnt Once we were seated everything was superb First shout out goes to the eggplant caponata served with the bread Can I take a jar of this home please So delicious The olive oil was also light lemony and amazing Second shout out is to the water pitchers Theyre beautiful and I want one of those to take home too For appetizers we had the creamy polenta with mushroom sauce which was rich and intensely creamy I loved the mushroom sauce and I dont usually like mushrooms We also shared the fried mozzarella with stewed baby tomatoes the cheese was good but the stewed tomato sauce was what really made this dish I got the duck foi gras ravioli they were amazing Little pillows of deliciousness in a thin cream sauce Again very rich so I was glad that the family wanted to share around because I might not have been able to finish the whole plate OK yes I would have but I might have regretted it later BF had the pasta with asparagus and corn which was the polar opposite to my pasta light crunchy and summery We were a little nervous about the corn but it was a winner Mom had the Sicilian duck which was cooked in a way that made it more like a red meat than a poultry It was really unique and very enjoyable Dad had the black cod with fennel which was also an interesting combination done perfectly For dessert we got the amedei chocolate cake which was wonderful but once again incredibly rich We also shared a peach shortbread with ice cream dessert which was sweet and delicious Loved them both All in all wonderful experience Cant wait to go back but Ill be making a reservation next time,0

"Sweet Baby Jesus, this cheesecake is amazing! I don't even like Cheesecake and I can't stop eating this stuff. Junior's is our first stop when we get to Manhattan, and our last stop before we leave. We usually get a slice to go in the middle of our trip, too. The burgers, pot roast, and sandwiches are all nice and crazy affordable...especially considering they are in the high-rent theater district in Midtown. My fave is the Devil's food...although the Carrot Cake and New York Style are nice, too. The Devil's food is tall, and then covered in whipped cream with a raspberry sauce...IF you request it...definitely request it. I order these for all my clients, friends, diabetic mother and always for my husband's birthday. When you love it as much as I do be sure to buy their cookbook on Amazon or at the restaurant...their cakes literally taste as good at home as they do in NYC.",5,Sweet Baby Jesus this cheesecake is amazing I dont even like Cheesecake and I cant stop eating this stuff Juniors is our first stop when we get to Manhattan and our last stop before we leave We usually get a slice to go in the middle of our trip too The burgers pot roast and sandwiches are all nice and crazy affordableespecially considering they are in the highrent theater district in Midtown My fave is the Devils foodalthough the Carrot Cake and New York Style are nice too The Devils food is tall and then covered in whipped cream with a raspberry sauceIF you request itdefinitely request it I order these for all my clients friends diabetic mother and always for my husbands birthday When you love it as much as I do be sure to buy their cookbook on Amazon or at the restauranttheir cakes literally taste as good at home as they do in NYC,0

That aside, I thought the fries were OK, nothing out of the ordinary and on the thick side. They had an assortment of condiments. I had the war sauce and what I believe was the Vietnamese Pineapple Mayo. Both were not bad but I prefer the sauces at Bareburger and Calexico. Not bad, would go again.

"My girlfriend and I ventured in here one night towards the end of happy hour. Everyone seemed to look like they were having a great time and there was a live DJ in the back (so why not go in).

I was about to ask for another drink when as soon as I finished my last sip, she had another one all ready! And if that wasn't enough the food was excellent as well!

"This place is a really nice experience. I can't think of one bad thing to say about it. It's definitely different from what you'd normally think of as Japanese food if when you think of it, all that comes up is sushi, terikyaki meats or ramen... First came here on a Friday night around 7pm and had no idea how popular it was. The wait for two was about 1 hour. We didn't do it, but I made a reservation instead for a Thursday at 6pm (they only take reservations for 6pm...not a huge problem, but kind of odd) We had the homemade tofu appetizer with 3 salts and it was a transcendent tofu experience. it hadn't occurred to me tofu could actually taste that good--and I was already a fan of the stuff before. It essentially tastes like the freshest soy milk you've ever had. Really light in texture and the wasabi salt is fantastic with it. I had the salmon sushi set, which came with miso soup and egg custard. It was all so good, I didn't leave one thing left on the tray. We split the matcha anmitsu for dessert and while the extras were ok, the green tea ice cream was the best, creamiest version I've ever had. service was good and the interior space is quite large and spacious.

"So I went for a light lunch here with a friend. So I don't feel that I truly experienced the place properly. That being said I have to comment about our lunch. (Side note, I live part time in Rome, italy...so maybe I come from a different point of view). We ordered the antipasto misto and the beet salad. The beet salad with ricotta was excellent we licked the plate. The antipasto misto came with 2 types of cheese, bresaola, speck, broccoli rabe and kale. The cheese was practically non existent. A sliver would be a compliant to how much they served. Barely experienced that. And both the bresaola and speck were very dry like if they were sliced hours ago and left out too long. The service was non existent too. The girl that served us was lovely the little that we saw her. I'm not so sure if I'd go back.

"My friends and I were definitely mistreated by the notorious hostess at this restaurant. Seeing that we were 3 not so rich college minority females, she told us to wait by the bar to get seated because we were waiting for two other people. Meanwhile, half the restaurant was empty. OK. About 15 minutes later, we're still waiting, an old Caucasian man with gold buckles on his shoes comes into the restaurant. He was also waiting for two guests. What happens? Does he wait by the bar like us? No. He gets seated immediately with 3 glasses of water on his table. At this point, the restaurant is still half empty. We weren't seated until our two other friends came 30 minutes later. You know what else was really professional? The pointing and snickering from the hostess and waiters. After being so thoroughly mistreated, we couldn't really enjoy the food... I recommend this place if you're really pretentious and you look like you have a lot of spend.

"I thought I had died and gone to heaven when my breakfast biscuit sandwich came out in it's cheesy, scrambled egg glory, topped with a generous smear of ""tomato jam,"" which is neither tomato paste nor tomato sauce nor salsa... but perfect for the sandwich. It came with a side of hash browns, and while the crispy part was yummy, it was a bit too mashed-potatoey for my tastes. The superstar of the spread was definitely the cheese grits, which depart from other cheese grits I've tried in that the cheese isn't sprinkled on top, but rather it is blended into the grits with mmmm butter! And they go so well with a fresh mimosa in the morning. Farmer's frittata was inventive: creamy goat cheese atop eggs, pesto, and mushrooms, but a little bland for me. Sweet potato fries nice and buttery, but too soft and not crunchy enough. It's pancake month and I may be back for the bananas foster pancakes on Feb 12-13th. The pancakes looked amazing.

"3 words. Oh. My. God. I love this restaurant. Admittedly, I have a huge bias because I'm an absolute fanatic for Italian food but Trattoria not only does it justice, when it gets something really right, it knocks it right out of the park with it's variety, freshness and exquisite flavor. The restaurant is located in Astoria and there's abundant street parking (metered). We went on a Thursday and it was comfortably full of people when we arrived about 8pm but we had no trouble getting a table after waiting 5 minutes. The crowd picked up a bit by the time we had gotten to our entrees. It has a nice laidback ambiance with brick ovens in the back and a live musician the night we went, as well as dimmed lighting, areas separated by decorative gating, exposed brick/mirrored walls. The service was impeccable. Our waiter was attentive and informative and props for being super patient when we had him re-recite parts of the verbal-only specials menu which was probably about 30 items long. Our glasses and bread bowl seemed bottomless and everyone at my table loved the tomato sauce that accompanied the bread. I wasn't a huge fan of the cold and somewhat mildly flavored sauce but I seemed to be in the minority. Trattoria included the usual olive oil with the bread as well as a bottle of their branded balsamic. Moving along to their appetizers, it was like they could do no wrong. Everything was mouthwatering, perfectly prepared and utterly delectable. We had the lobster salad, the Prosciuotto with huge balls of fresh Mozzarrella and a melts-in-your-mouth beef Carpaccio. Utter heaven. It was all so flavorful, tender and fresh, all we could do was sigh in bliss with each mouthful. For the entrees, this was more of a mixed bag, probably at least partially due to the way our table ordered. One person ordered off the specials menu with a veal and some other meat (sorry, slips my mind atm) filled ravioli which he said was tasty but otherwise left no strong impression. Then, two others decided to custom order something that wasn't on any of the menus which the restaurant was gamely more than willing to accommodate. They got the Shrimp fra Diavlo which they cited as average due to it's lacking any real kick. Although the pasta was cooked al dente and the shrimps were fresh, the dish was uninspired. I ordered the Risotto alla Zia Minuccia which is on the regular menu. It's heaven for the cheese & mushroom lover, a creamy and rich confection of carb-saturated goodness. The ultimate comfort food that left me thoroughly stuffed only halfway into the dish which I was doing my best to shovel it all in fast as I could. Alas, it defeated me but that just meant plenty leftover to take home. :) By the time dessert rolled around, we were just plain too stuffed to even contemplate some confectionary goodness. The tab wasn't too bad, it came out to roughly $47/per person including appetizer, entree, misc drinks (we didn't indulge in a bottle), tax and tip. All in all, a satisfying evening and I'll definiitely be back. The only caveat with this place and keeping it from being 5 stars is that not all the pasta dishes are consistently awesome. As with prob any restaurant, some dishes are standouts while others are mediocre. You just have to experiment until you find that drool-inducing gem. I also haven't tried their seafood yet so this rating may yet change after subsequent visits. :)",4,3 words Oh My God I love this restaurant Admittedly I have a huge bias because Im an absolute fanatic for Italian food but Trattoria not only does it justice when it gets something really right it knocks it right out of the park with its variety freshness and exquisite flavor The restaurant is located in Astoria and theres abundant street parking metered We went on a Thursday and it was comfortably full of people when we arrived about 8pm but we had no trouble getting a table after waiting 5 minutes The crowd picked up a bit by the time we had gotten to our entrees It has a nice laidback ambiance with brick ovens in the back and a live musician the night we went as well as dimmed lighting areas separated by decorative gating exposed brickmirrored walls The service was impeccable Our waiter was attentive and informative and props for being super patient when we had him rerecite parts of the verbalonly specials menu which was probably about 30 items long Our glasses and bread bowl seemed bottomless and everyone at my table loved the tomato sauce that accompanied the bread I wasnt a huge fan of the cold and somewhat mildly flavored sauce but I seemed to be in the minority Trattoria included the usual olive oil with the bread as well as a bottle of their branded balsamic Moving along to their appetizers it was like they could do no wrong Everything was mouthwatering perfectly prepared and utterly delectable We had the lobster salad the Prosciuotto with huge balls of fresh Mozzarrella and a meltsinyourmouth beef Carpaccio Utter heaven It was all so flavorful tender and fresh all we could do was sigh in bliss with each mouthful For the entrees this was more of a mixed bag probably at least partially due to the way our table ordered One person ordered off the specials menu with a veal and some other meat sorry slips my mind atm filled ravioli which he said was tasty but otherwise left no strong impression Then two others decided to custom order something that wasnt on any of the menus which the restaurant was gamely more than willing to accommodate They got the Shrimp fra Diavlo which they cited as average due to its lacking any real kick Although the pasta was cooked al dente and the shrimps were fresh the dish was uninspired I ordered the Risotto alla Zia Minuccia which is on the regular menu Its heaven for the cheese mushroom lover a creamy and rich confection of carbsaturated goodness The ultimate comfort food that left me thoroughly stuffed only halfway into the dish which I was doing my best to shovel it all in fast as I could Alas it defeated me but that just meant plenty leftover to take home By the time dessert rolled around we were just plain too stuffed to even contemplate some confectionary goodness The tab wasnt too bad it came out to roughly 47per person including appetizer entree misc drinks we didnt indulge in a bottle tax and tip All in all a satisfying evening and Ill definiitely be back The only caveat with this place and keeping it from being 5 stars is that not all the pasta dishes are consistently awesome As with prob any restaurant some dishes are standouts while others are mediocre You just have to experiment until you find that droolinducing gem I also havent tried their seafood yet so this rating may yet change after subsequent visits,0

"Be forewarned - I came here with a party of 3 for brunch/lunch around 12:30 and we waited more than an hour in the cold to be seated without so much a word of warning from the servers that it would be so long. Getting seated as two is much, much faster. But ignoring that, let's get down to the real topic, which is the quality of the food. The three of us each got eggs florentine with smoked salmon and some pierogies to share. NEVER, EVER get the pierogies at Nook. They are absolutely terrible. They look and taste as though they boiled some pierogies out of the frozen boxes from walmart. Absolutely not worth $14 for 8. The eggs florentine were decent. The portions were well-sized and the eggs were well cooked. However, the eggs florentine just didn't stand out for me compared to other brunch places.

"Pretty good but not great. They have some dishes with inventive ingredients (lobster something, papaya noodle pad thai, etc.), but the hype and prices are a bit high, especially for the portion size. Last time I went for dinner, our food was very slow to arrive--the waiter was polite when he ferried our belated dishes over. Now there are fewer things on the lunch specials menu (used to be a solid, tasty deal), so I'm less inclined. I rounded my 2.5 stars down to a 2, but after that Village Voice writeup, this place will do just fine anyway, I'm sure.",2,Pretty good but not great They have some dishes with inventive ingredients lobster something papaya noodle pad thai etc but the hype and prices are a bit high especially for the portion size Last time I went for dinner our food was very slow to arrivethe waiter was polite when he ferried our belated dishes over Now there are fewer things on the lunch specials menu used to be a solid tasty deal so Im less inclined I rounded my 25 stars down to a 2 but after that Village Voice writeup this place will do just fine anyway Im sure,0

"Came in a big group on a Saturday night. The place is so cute inside with an open kitchen view from the corner table where we sat. I also liked the lighting and the chalk board on the walls that had the specials written on them. We tried a couple of the apps, all good especailly the beef carpaccio. The entrees that we ordered were the pancetta wrapped pork tenderloin, scallops, and chicken-everything came out nice. The desserts were especially yummy, we tried the chocolate cake but the winner was the upside down pineapple rhubarb cake.

"This place is great, and cheap as heck. $9 gets you a ""medium"" sized plate with a protein, veggie, and grain. My boyfriend and I shared two dinners: spare ribs, quinoa and broccoli/carrots/cauliflower, and chicken curry/rice and peas/cabbage. Both were very good. They needed hot sauce, but luckily we had some. We had enough left over for one of us (me) to eat it for lunch the next day. We also got two pieces of bread/cake for breakfast the next day: lemon and banana. Both were great. I've also tried the Jamaican pattie with chicken inside. The outside was tasty (extremely flaky!) but the soy chicken had an oddly sweet and mushy flavor/texture. Not necessarily bad, just not what I expected. I will say that I'd eat there more often if they offered less processed kinds of meat substitutes. I try to avoid processed soy products if I can and stick to simpler stuff like tofu, tempeh, and seitan. So I'm not going to eat there every day. But when I do, it is a delightful treat. It would also be good if they had some kind of sauteed greens as I'm sure they'd be delicious!

"One thing that I wasn't prepared for upon my first visit to the Green Table was how few tables the place has. This is a TINY enclave attached to a meat and produce company. My girlfriend and I were laughing that the menu noted ""gratuities automatically included for parties larger than 6""...im not sure you could FIT a part of 6 in there! I mean, literally, there were only about 5 tables...and one long bench out in the hallway. That said, what a unique experience. This restaruant is inside the Chelsea Market and, as noted, has some seating literally outside in the hallway (we sat inside). The decor is muted but cute and fits the vibe of the place. Fresh foods and greens...from sustainable local farms. Great music vibe (it was the waitress' ipod), too. As for our meal, the portions were perfectly sized...small, but not small enough that we walked out hungry. I had the hangar steak which was delicious and my vegitarian date had mushroom pot pie. They have some very good sides, too, and our server recommended I get one so I wouldn't walk out hungry (she was right on). I got the mac and cheese, and it was great. Oh, and let me not forget the beer (they only serve wine and beer). They have a small menu of unique microbrews, some of them organic. The Three Philosophers Belgian Ale was absolutely fantastic...one of the best beers I've ever had. Definately worth ordering! It's full and spicy and extrememly tasty. Also, it's 9.8% alcohol, which is certainly a plus. Overall, this is just a unique dining experience. If you are looking for a large, happening scene and lots of people to watch, then this isn't your place. But if you want some honestly prepared, very fresh food for decent prices in a rather unconventional atmosphere, then I would highly recommend The Green Table.",4,One thing that I wasnt prepared for upon my first visit to the Green Table was how few tables the place has This is a TINY enclave attached to a meat and produce company My girlfriend and I were laughing that the menu noted gratuities automatically included for parties larger than 6im not sure you could FIT a part of 6 in there I mean literally there were only about 5 tablesand one long bench out in the hallway That said what a unique experience This restaruant is inside the Chelsea Market and as noted has some seating literally outside in the hallway we sat inside The decor is muted but cute and fits the vibe of the place Fresh foods and greensfrom sustainable local farms Great music vibe it was the waitress ipod too As for our meal the portions were perfectly sizedsmall but not small enough that we walked out hungry I had the hangar steak which was delicious and my vegitarian date had mushroom pot pie They have some very good sides too and our server recommended I get one so I wouldnt walk out hungry she was right on I got the mac and cheese and it was great Oh and let me not forget the beer they only serve wine and beer They have a small menu of unique microbrews some of them organic The Three Philosophers Belgian Ale was absolutely fantasticone of the best beers Ive ever had Definately worth ordering Its full and spicy and extrememly tasty Also its 98 alcohol which is certainly a plus Overall this is just a unique dining experience If you are looking for a large happening scene and lots of people to watch then this isnt your place But if you want some honestly prepared very fresh food for decent prices in a rather unconventional atmosphere then I would highly recommend The Green Table,0

"We walked in and were seated at the last available table, which happened to be right in the middle, giving us a captain's view of the decorations - old books and wood and perfect lighting. As our places were set and our water glasses filled, our waiter, Greg, walked up and was an absolute star who made great recommendations. First we ordered drinks. I was feeling like something fruity, and he recommended the Autumn Bramble from the bar, which was made with fruit jam and fruit liqueur, and had more of the fruitiness of a bowl of fresh cut berries than that of an appletini, which was delightful. The bf ordered the Spiced Rum Punch. Now, you may be thinking, ""Punch? You mean like jungle juice from my first frat party?"" Yes! And hell no! Much like my Autumn Bramble, this drink was strong without an overwhelming boozy taste, which covers the yes. But instead of tasting like pure sugar, it balanced apple, cinnamon, and other spices into a refreshing and warming beverage, covering the hell no. We ordered the brussel sprout side as our appetizer, and it was amazing. Tastefully greased greens and light and flaky pork (prosciutto?) were the perfect combo to whet our appetites. Then came the entrees. I ordered the half chicken with potatoes and cole slaw. The chicken was well seasoned and tender, and the buttery sauce complemented the dish well. The potatoes were unique, both firm and soft, mushy and flaky. It's as if the potato wanted to be the Leonardo da Vinci of potatoes, a Renaissance Spud, you could say. The other side of the table was filled with grilled sea bass with green beans and the cutest little grilled eggplants. They were the size of heirloom potatoes, to give you an idea of what I'm talking about. And the sea bass? Delicious! So soft and flaky, truly cooked to perfection. This was all served on a plate of spicy green curry sauce, that had a bit of a kick that was just right. The portions were fair, and we could have easily called it a night right there. But as this was my last night here, we decided to splurge on our bellies and order the dessert. After our server finished describing the dessert - vanilla ice cream with caramel, marshmallow sauce, and pretzels in a mason jar, I told him I would think about it. In the 3.5 seconds it took him to go to the next table and collect their check, we caved and got it. It was a nice and comforting end to an otherwise delightful dinner. I would love to come here again. I *did* visit on a Monday night, so walking in at 8pm to no wait for a table for two might not be your experience on the weekend. They ran out of the special between the time we sat down and the time the order went in, which was minimally disappointing.

Unfortunately La Superior was closed so I decided to try this place even tho' most of the reviews said bad things. I didn't want chicken so ordered the cat fish which was discribed as 2 filets fried. I also ordered a watermelon agua fresca. The catfish I was told came with tarter sauce and Cole slaw. I also had potato salade. The space was nice and uncrowded. Before stepping down into the seating area I spied 2 sad pies near the register. The cat fish was just two skinny strips dredged in cornmeal. The tarter sauce was runny milky liquid with pickle and dill. The potato salade was just boiled potato drowning in the same milky liquid. The slaw was over chopped and tasteless. The watermelon juice was good but served in a small glass. La Superior serves fresh in a tall glass. Worth the price. Maybe the chicken is what to get. The family funded restaurant has the right idea but sadly I wasted 13 bucks on milky runny liquid and two dried out fish stix. Proceed with caution.

"This restaurant is legit! They offer three tasting/feast menus: vegetarian, seafood, and pork, in addition to ""a la carte"" options. Everyone in your party must order the same feast. I really like this concept as it simplifies the ordering process. Plus everyone gets a good portion of each dish. My wife and I selected the pork feast, which was out of control amazing. Every single thing we ate was delicious. In particular, I enjoyed the stuffed squash blossom filled with BBQ pulled pork, the crispy pig's ear salad, and the bacon & egg (pork belly, grits, and quail egg). Damn good! The berkshire pork tenderloin must have been sprinkled with crack. We also ordered oysters as an appetizer, which were perfect. We went here on a rainy Tuesday night and every seat was taken.

"Truly the best pure sushi/sashmi place in town! As someone who used to live on the West Coast, where fish is caught directly out of the ocean and then finds its way into the better sushi restaurants in a matter of hours, I can say that the sushi at Yasuda is the real deal. The sashimi, in particular, is divine - they literally melt in your mouth! Yasuda is not the place to go if you are looking for creativity, or more North American style gimmick rolls (i.e. spicy tuna, dragon rolls, california rolls) etc. This is a purest's place, with the freshness of the fish being the highlight.

"With a name like Noodle Pudding, I was a bit reluctant...but hey, why the hell not! I went with a group of six for my birthday early this month and the food was great! I am still thinking about the endive, walnut, and goat cheese salad today. Add the grilled calamari to the mix and you're good to go. We also had the penne and grilled fish and two bottles of wine. Of course I didn't pay because it was my birthday but the total still came up to only $30/person. I only gave it four stars instead of five because our waitress was a bit distracted and spacey. She was helpful but she seemed rushed the entire night.",4,With a name like Noodle Pudding I was a bit reluctantbut hey why the hell not I went with a group of six for my birthday early this month and the food was great I am still thinking about the endive walnut and goat cheese salad today Add the grilled calamari to the mix and youre good to go We also had the penne and grilled fish and two bottles of wine Of course I didnt pay because it was my birthday but the total still came up to only 30person I only gave it four stars instead of five because our waitress was a bit distracted and spacey She was helpful but she seemed rushed the entire night,0
"definitely must try: beef pancake for $1.75. Their dumplings are cheap and they definitely put a lot of meat/chives in their fillings however I also think they put a lot msg into their fillings as well. had a slight headache and was thirsty after having them. I'd skip them. But this is all because I grew up eating mom's homemade dumpling, so I'm a little picker with them.

"The service was fine, not particularly friendly or rude, just doing their basic job of serving food. We went on a Saturday night at 7 and waited maybe 5 minutes for our reservation.

"Best lunch in NY.....my mom and i walked past on Saturday afternoon; didn't know what to expect. Ended up picking & choosing whatever looked good and shared everything. yummy, especially the mushroom quiche, the roasted eggplant and the sun dried tomato hummus. In fact, was so good, we brought my husband back the next day. he had a gyro and absolutely loved it. This is our new favorite place for a quick, healthy, interesting lunch. Only regret is that there isn't a location on the East side! P.S. one of the employees was handing out free samples of falafels outside; we watched as people were practically diving over themselves to get to them. he must have gone through 3-4 trays of food in about 10 minutes.... everyone on the staff was exceedingly friendly and helpful, from the manager down to the cashier.",5,Best lunch in NYmy mom and i walked past on Saturday afternoon didnt know what to expect Ended up picking choosing whatever looked good and shared everything yummy especially the mushroom quiche the roasted eggplant and the sun dried tomato hummus In fact was so good we brought my husband back the next day he had a gyro and absolutely loved it This is our new favorite place for a quick healthy interesting lunch Only regret is that there isnt a location on the East side PS one of the employees was handing out free samples of falafels outside we watched as people were practically diving over themselves to get to them he must have gone through 34 trays of food in about 10 minutes everyone on the staff was exceedingly friendly and helpful from the manager down to the cashier,0
"Small place with outdoor seating and nouveau-Peruvian cuisine... Went with my two Peruvian cousins to support and explore the new spot... We ordered eggs benedict, crispy oysters, salmon anticuchos, ceviche, ceviche mixto, tuna tartar, grilled corn, papa a la huancaina, lomo saltado, tilapia entree with cilantro rice and a tuna entree (I think it was tuna, it had a puree, rather forgettable dish), espressos, beers, prosercco and churros... Benedict and tacu tacu was delicious, I love eggs with rice and beans, we devoured this but the home fries were to typical and reminiscent of a diner... Crispy oysters (3 oysters) and salmon skewers were delicious, (two skewers per order) Ceviches were innovative and FRESH. The lomo saltado did not disappoint... The tilapia with cilantro rice was a great dish, great sauce, so tasty we ordered an extra side of the rice... Waitress Andy was sweet, Chef Miguel said hello to patrons, churros were ok, espresso was bueno... I enjoyed the Chef's vision and new presentations of classic Peruvian dishes and his exploration into new flavor profiles...

We wanted to get a snack so we ""manned"" a table (stand up and informal bar tables - no seating) at the cured meats section.

"I came here for dinner tonight and my friends and I were SO impressed! Everything we ordered was absolutely delicious! Although this place is tiny, the quality and taste of food made up for it. The menu is small plates tapas, so we shared a bunch of small plates. We started the the beet salad. It was huge. A tower of beets with goat cheese and salad. It was good, but I thought the cheese was a bit too strong for my taste. The brussels sprouts were delicious! I loved it! The tomato bread was very crispy, soft and yummy. For our main small plates, the skirt steak was outstanding!!! The beef was so juicy and the tomato sauce was very sweet and spicy! The lamb shank was also a favorite. The meat was very tender and it fell right off the bone. The last dish we had was the tripe with chickpeas and sausage. Great combinations of flavors and it was a unique way of preparing tripe. Dessert was a great way to end a delicious meal. I, of course, had the bread pudding. It was SO good. It was the perfect crispy and moist texture with creamy cinnamon ice cream. YUM! The burnt cream brulee with deep fried bay leaves were really good! The bay leaves were soaked in batter and then deep fried. I loved it!

"Couple's date night on a Thursday for a party of four. We were seated right on-time and put our trust in our servers hands. I ordered the bone marrow and the beef dumplings and listened as our server read out all their most popular dishes. We did kind of over order though. By the time we got to plate 6, we had no idea how to find room for plates 7 and 8. But we persevered! The most memorable dish was the grilled octopus - it was prepared perfectly. I could have also eaten multiple helpings of the duck shawarma. The Tabbouleh salad and thyme salad were equally delightful. The only dish I could have skipped was the lamb sausage, it was just ok. The candy bar dessert was so so so sinful. Find room for it, if you can. We also enjoyed some special margarita pomegranate cocktail that night.

"Average for brunch. Prix fixe is reasonable for NYC standards BUT there is nothing remarkable about the food. Decor and wait staff aside, it's not French by any stretch of the imagination. My food was bland and shapeless--and who serves French fries at brunch? Hash browns would be better. Not to mention my ""wild mushroom"" omelette was placed on top of the side salad, wilting all the lettuce and destroying its flavor.

"I love Alameda. I have been lazy about writing reviews, except in horrible encounters, but I'm writing about Alameda because It's so great. Short but well-curated/diverse list of beers on tap. Great craft cocktails (interesting ingredients and riffs on classics). Again, well-curated/edited wine list. I've eaten here 6+ times over the past 6 months, almost always on Sunday nights. My boyfriend LOVES the cheeseburger and fries. He said it's possibly the best burger he's had in NYC because it's simple and pared down- just juicy meat, a slice of Cheddar, and he puts mayo on the bun. The boquerones, corn dish (summer seasonal), oysters, and trout have all been delicious. The first time we came for food, we had low expectations... but it was so delicious that we kept coming back. One very consistent thing: the staff have always been AMAZINGLY attentive. Not intrusive, but always present, accommodating, and quick to bus table/bring drinks.

"Ok, look. The food is good. Do not get me wrong. You won't be disappointed with that. But the service and the people that work there.....not good. Came in, was seated. No one gave us any water or anything. We asked for it, received some attitude, and our waitress then proceeded to never get us water and decided to just dance around the restaurant thinking she was really cool instead. When we asked her for it again, she acted like she had never heard us the first time. Also mind you, it was a cold, rainy day. And all of the windows were open. When asked if it was possible to close the windows, the woman basically said ""I can try but I need ventilation in here"" ok??? Apparently it WAS cold because soon after, the people working there put shirts on! Not to mention there are windows all around the place, she could have just closed ours and went on with her day. But again with the attitude. Lastly, as she took our plates away, she noticed I was still finishing my food and literally TOSSED the dipping sauce across the table at me. Oh, thanks a lot. For throwing that little cup at me. It really put a damper on the whole thing and it's too bad. What is it about the NoLita neighborhood that everyone is TOO COOL TO GIVE YOU SERVICE ???????????????

"Now I'm no connoisseur of Peruvian cuisine and to be honest, this was my first experience but boy was it good enough to make me a fan. This place is generous with their food servings and for a reasonable price as well. I came here with a friend, so we didn't order much. Just two dishes, the jalea and the chicken. Not quite sure what to expect when we ordered the jalea, I was beyond overjoyed when they brought out a huge dish, and mind you this was the small portion, of deep fried seafood goodness. The fried food wasn't the least bit oily and it was topped off with this ceviche style onion garnish that had me wishing I had a second stomach to order one of their ceviche dishes. The chicken was delicious and moist. Thinking about it again has me salivating. Walking distance from Penn Station, it's easy to find, but with the hustle and bustle probably goes unnoticed. If you ever find yourself in the area looking for a not so light snack, this is definitely a place to stop by. To top it all off, the service is just as great as the food.",5,Now Im no connoisseur of Peruvian cuisine and to be honest this was my first experience but boy was it good enough to make me a fan This place is generous with their food servings and for a reasonable price as well I came here with a friend so we didnt order much Just two dishes the jalea and the chicken Not quite sure what to expect when we ordered the jalea I was beyond overjoyed when they brought out a huge dish and mind you this was the small portion of deep fried seafood goodness The fried food wasnt the least bit oily and it was topped off with this ceviche style onion garnish that had me wishing I had a second stomach to order one of their ceviche dishes The chicken was delicious and moist Thinking about it again has me salivating Walking distance from Penn Station its easy to find but with the hustle and bustle probably goes unnoticed If you ever find yourself in the area looking for a not so light snack this is definitely a place to stop by To top it all off the service is just as great as the food,0

"I was visiting NYC and wanted to indulge in some of the native Filipino dishes I haven't had in years. I was really excited when I found this place through yelp and had been looking forward to coming here since I started planning my trip (additionally, I had been going through the online menu numerous times in anticipation). However, I was very disappointed first with the service. I expected to not have such great, personalized service in NYC but this was even worse than my low expectations. The waiter pretty much seated us, brought some water (which he never refilled even after passing by our table numerous times and looking over, seeing that it's been empty for a long time). He's been to the table once to take the order (in the process, running off immediately after taking the order without even asking or waiting to see if we wanted a different beverage other than water) and I suppose, that was the owner that brought us our food. Unfortunately, this is mostly the reason why I am giving Grill 21 a low rating. Putting all that aside, the food was okay. I know I couldn't eat everything but I wanted to try a variety of things so among the dishes ordered were: lechon kawali, the breakfast thing with tocino, and pancit bihon. The lechon kawali was a bit like overcooked pork and not very flavorful. Their pancit bihon was actually the best of all the dishes I've tried there. As I don't ever remember having tocino when I lived in the Philippines, I can't really give it either a seal of approval or disapproval but it was okay if you're into cured, sweet pork.",2,I was visiting NYC and wanted to indulge in some of the native Filipino dishes I havent had in years I was really excited when I found this place through yelp and had been looking forward to coming here since I started planning my trip additionally I had been going through the online menu numerous times in anticipation However I was very disappointed first with the service I expected to not have such great personalized service in NYC but this was even worse than my low expectations The waiter pretty much seated us brought some water which he never refilled even after passing by our table numerous times and looking over seeing that its been empty for a long time Hes been to the table once to take the order in the process running off immediately after taking the order without even asking or waiting to see if we wanted a different beverage other than water and I suppose that was the owner that brought us our food Unfortunately this is mostly the reason why I am giving Grill 21 a low rating Putting all that aside the food was okay I know I couldnt eat everything but I wanted to try a variety of things so among the dishes ordered were lechon kawali the breakfast thing with tocino and pancit bihon The lechon kawali was a bit like overcooked pork and not very flavorful Their pancit bihon was actually the best of all the dishes Ive tried there As I dont ever remember having tocino when I lived in the Philippines I cant really give it either a seal of approval or disapproval but it was okay if youre into cured sweet pork,0

"Two really great delivery orders + an awesome birthday dinner at the restaurant? Who wouldn't give Black Sea Fish & Grill 5 stars? Four stars for delivery. As far as delivery service goes, the food is well packaged and as prompt as it can be. The 5th star comes from our actual dinner at the restaurant for my sister's birthday. The waitstaff was friendly and attentive. The service was prompt and the food came out fast. Between the two deliveries and sit down dinner, our favorite dishes were Appetizers Char Grilled Octopus Salad ($12.00) tossed with garlic, lemon juice, and vinegar. Patlican Ezmesi ($5.75) baba ghanoush. puree of eggplant, flavored with tahini, olive oil, onion and garlic. Entrees (Fish Entres. All Main Courses Are Served With Pilaf, Fresh Onion, Roasted Green Peppers And Tomatoes.) St. Peter's Fish ($19.75) flaky white meat, ordered as a whole or filet. char-grilled or lightly pan-fried. Always get the fish whole and char grilled. Always. Karides Guvec ($19.75) shrimp casserole. large size shrimp baked in casserole with fresh vegetables topped with melted yellow cheese. Black Sea Surf And Turf ($19.75) Platter baby lamb chops and large size shrimp char-grilled to your plate. Ahtapot Guvec ($19.75) octopus casserole. fresh octopus baked in a casserole with mushroom, fresh tomatoes, red bell peppers and garlic. As if the food and atmosphere couldn't get any better, the waiters surprised my sister (and the table) with a plate of mixed desserts and a plate of mixed fruit....on the house!!

"Confusing. Ok, I went here as a tourist 2 weeks ago and I thought the whole layout was really confusing and not tourist friendly. I get that they are going for this whole ""open market"" concept or whatever but a downside to that is a lack of service. You walk in there and it is pretty much up to you to navigate your way through the crowds of people and grab a waiter to serve you and find a host for the different seated venues. It was kind of a hot mess. I ended up eating at Il Pesce and had a really great squid entree with a side of beets and an appetizer of mussels.

I like this place for breakfast lunch and dinner. The staff is friendly. The place has an upbeat engaging atmosphere. There is a great spirit of camaraderie among the mostly male waiters. I don't speak a word of Spanish and I love it. It is hard to get much healthier than rice and beans! The pork and chicken dishes are excellent and Thursday and Friday they have baked fish which is terrific. They make their own hot sauce which is also excellent. For some of the pork dishes you can get fresh crushed garlic and oil to put on top of the roast pig on Saturday and the fresh ham on other days of the week.,5,I like this place for breakfast lunch and dinner The staff is friendly The place has an upbeat engaging atmosphere There is a great spirit of camaraderie among the mostly male waiters I dont speak a word of Spanish and I love it It is hard to get much healthier than rice and beans The pork and chicken dishes are excellent and Thursday and Friday they have baked fish which is terrific They make their own hot sauce which is also excellent For some of the pork dishes you can get fresh crushed garlic and oil to put on top of the roast pig on Saturday and the fresh ham on other days of the week,0

"This relative newcomer in Park Slope is a place of highs and lows, so much so that after dining there last week, we left befuddled and unable to clearly answer a basic question: had we enjoyed the meal? The Pros: Get Fresh is a welcoming, if spare, space on the southern end of Park Slope's 5th Avenue. The servers are friendly and attentive and the menu purports to offer local, organic, sustainable fare (see below, though). Plus, it's one of the few BYOB restaurants around, which really helps cut down on the dinner bill. Some of the dishes we tried were really outstanding. Our starter, for instance, of Rabbit-Pork sausage served atop a bed of creamy truffled potato puree, was divine. We literally wiped the plate clean with our fingers. But, oddly, rather than being housemade (as one might expect from a place championing great local food), the sausage was from D'Artagnan (this was disappointing, somehow. Though, at least now I know where I can order the sausage for myself...). Another winner was a side dish we ordered, Mexican Beans and Rice. Usually a throwaway, this dish was full of flavor and texture. Our dessert, a chocolate ""cake"" (really more like two incredibly tender brownies held together with a thick serving of ganache) was also a plate-licker. Weirdly, though, this wasn't made in the restaurant either, but at a local bakery. The Cons Some of the dishes were downright awful. I ordered the Hawaiian prawns with sweet potato puree expecting plump prawns set atop a bed of flavorful puree. Instead the pawns were coated with the puree, creating a mushy dish with a horrifying mouth-feel. It was barely edible when it could have been great. Plus, Hawaiian prawns at a place bragging about local food? Really? My husband's entree (the smoked pork belly with tamales and mole) was fine - good, not great. So, in sum, Get Fresh had some real highs and real lows and very little in between. Coupled with so much of their food being prepared off-site, we just felt that the whole experience was very unrestaurant-y and were uncertain if we'd return or not.",3,This relative newcomer in Park Slope is a place of highs and lows so much so that after dining there last week we left befuddled and unable to clearly answer a basic question had we enjoyed the meal The Pros Get Fresh is a welcoming if spare space on the southern end of Park Slopes 5th Avenue The servers are friendly and attentive and the menu purports to offer local organic sustainable fare see below though Plus its one of the few BYOB restaurants around which really helps cut down on the dinner bill Some of the dishes we tried were really outstanding Our starter for instance of RabbitPork sausage served atop a bed of creamy truffled potato puree was divine We literally wiped the plate clean with our fingers But oddly rather than being housemade as one might expect from a place championing great local food the sausage was from DArtagnan this was disappointing somehow Though at least now I know where I can order the sausage for myself Another winner was a side dish we ordered Mexican Beans and Rice Usually a throwaway this dish was full of flavor and texture Our dessert a chocolate cake really more like two incredibly tender brownies held together with a thick serving of ganache was also a platelicker Weirdly though this wasnt made in the restaurant either but at a local bakery The Cons Some of the dishes were downright awful I ordered the Hawaiian prawns with sweet potato puree expecting plump prawns set atop a bed of flavorful puree Instead the pawns were coated with the puree creating a mushy dish with a horrifying mouthfeel It was barely edible when it could have been great Plus Hawaiian prawns at a place bragging about local food Really My husbands entree the smoked pork belly with tamales and mole was fine good not great So in sum Get Fresh had some real highs and real lows and very little in between Coupled with so much of their food being prepared offsite we just felt that the whole experience was very unrestauranty and were uncertain if wed return or not,0

Everything was incredibly fresh and flavorful. The only complaint I have is that I wish the chef had communicated with us more so that we would understand how omakase works here. I guess it's because I never had it before but we they kept eating everything they were serving us until we literally could not breathe. I finally asked him how much more do we have to go and he looked and me and said ""you were supposed to tell me when to stop"". -___-;; We literally ate everything on the menu. Seriously.

"Let's cut to the important part - this product works, and works well. The litter stays perfectly clean and raked, and I only need to empty the waste bin (easy when you use a grocery bag as a liner) once a week or so. That's the good part. The bad part is it's been relentlessly unreliable. It will jam if you put even slightly too much litter in it. I've had burned out motors, squeaky conveyors, and busted sensors. I've disassembled and reassembled it countless times. That being said, it's a simple machine, and some basic mechanical inclination will allow one to service this accordingly. My first unit was missing a few minor, non-critical parts, and the motor burned out after a month or so, making a squealing noise from day one that made my cat afraid to use it. I had disassembled, lubricated, and reassembled multiple times. I contacted PetSafe, which was awesome. They sent me an entirely new unit without asking me to return the old unit, so I officially had a new one with an old one for parts. Since replacing the unit with the new one, it's still been slightly finnicky, but notably better than the old one. I've still had to make a few repairs, but again, for someone with basical mechanical aptitude, it's not hard. So yes, it's been less than reliable, but my wife and I love it, and we can't imagine going back to scooping again. I'd have to say, if this replacement one fails, I'll be happy to replace it with the same unit.",4,Lets cut to the important part this product works and works well The litter stays perfectly clean and raked and I only need to empty the waste bin easy when you use a grocery bag as a liner once a week or so Thats the good part The bad part is its been relentlessly unreliable It will jam if you put even slightly too much litter in it Ive had burned out motors squeaky conveyors and busted sensors Ive disassembled and reassembled it countless times That being said its a simple machine and some basic mechanical inclination will allow one to service this accordingly My first unit was missing a few minor noncritical parts and the motor burned out after a month or so making a squealing noise from day one that made my cat afraid to use it I had disassembled lubricated and reassembled multiple times I contacted PetSafe which was awesome They sent me an entirely new unit without asking me to return the old unit so I officially had a new one with an old one for parts Since replacing the unit with the new one its still been slightly finnicky but notably better than the old one Ive still had to make a few repairs but again for someone with basical mechanical aptitude its not hard So yes its been less than reliable but my wife and I love it and we cant imagine going back to scooping again Id have to say if this replacement one fails Ill be happy to replace it with the same unit,0

"This is a great place to grab brunch! The one downer is there's a lack of the sweeter items on the menu--I'm usually a pancakes/waffles kind of girl, but otherwise the menu selection is great! Plus, their free table bread was delicious and definitely satisfied my sweet tooth. Almost everything in that bread basket had chocolate chips in it! I ordered the wild mushroom paella served with green bean salad and sweet pea dressing--it was a generous helping of flavored rice mixed with mushrooms(although I couldn't find too many of them, the ones I did find were delicious) topped with the salad and dressing. A little on the salty side, but nothing the bottomless sangria bar couldn't fix. We came in a group of 6 and walked in the day of to sit in the lounge area which is really nice. Next time I go I'll try to make a reservation in the dining room, which is a high-ceiling well-lit gorgeous area. I think they even have a little taco truck being pushed around with bottomless tacos!

Don't come a prime time and expect speedy grub: the line can be long. Good things take time. This place does not serve food in a New York minute.

"Met a friend on a friday night and chose to go here based solely on the high score here on yelp. It seemed very busy with a crowd standing around the front, the hostess said it would be a 30 minute wait. It wound up only being about 5 minutes until we were huddled into a cramped table between three bro dudes getting drunk on Corona and the bathroom. It was so loud inside that we had to yell to each other all night sitting face to face just to have a normal conversation. All of this is pretty typical for a place like this on a friday night on the lower east side, so it has little effect on my review. I give it 1 star based on my experience with their food. I like cuban food and having lived in South Florida for 8 years, Ive had my fair share. The menu claims that their cuban sandwich was voted ""Best in New York."" This is actually the first Cuban restaurant I've been to in the city, but if this is the best New York has to offer I might have write off Cuban food til I return to Florida. First of all, someone needs to tell the chef at Cafe Habana that a cuban sandwich is supposed to be pressed. My friend and I both ordered the sandwich and they came out on a hard, flaky club roll that wasn't even warm, let alone hot pressed. The ham was cold and thickly cut. The cheese not melted. The one part that stood out was the pork, however. It was actually very good, and if they just knew how to craft a cuban sandwich it could actually be pretty good because this roast pork had some nice flavor. Sadly, it alone wasn't enough to make the sandwich appetizing. Paired with a handful of bland diner style french fries, I left hungry and disappointed.",1,Met a friend on a friday night and chose to go here based solely on the high score here on yelp It seemed very busy with a crowd standing around the front the hostess said it would be a 30 minute wait It wound up only being about 5 minutes until we were huddled into a cramped table between three bro dudes getting drunk on Corona and the bathroom It was so loud inside that we had to yell to each other all night sitting face to face just to have a normal conversation All of this is pretty typical for a place like this on a friday night on the lower east side so it has little effect on my review I give it 1 star based on my experience with their food I like cuban food and having lived in South Florida for 8 years Ive had my fair share The menu claims that their cuban sandwich was voted Best in New York This is actually the first Cuban restaurant Ive been to in the city but if this is the best New York has to offer I might have write off Cuban food til I return to Florida First of all someone needs to tell the chef at Cafe Habana that a cuban sandwich is supposed to be pressed My friend and I both ordered the sandwich and they came out on a hard flaky club roll that wasnt even warm let alone hot pressed The ham was cold and thickly cut The cheese not melted The one part that stood out was the pork however It was actually very good and if they just knew how to craft a cuban sandwich it could actually be pretty good because this roast pork had some nice flavor Sadly it alone wasnt enough to make the sandwich appetizing Paired with a handful of bland diner style french fries I left hungry and disappointed,0
"Yep. It's just as good as everyone says.

"Small portion, overpriced, if you haven't had anything similar, then OK to try to impress your date (if he/she also never experienced it). I certainly wouldn't recommend you to take your Japanese friends there. Service is good, the ingredients are good. But the drawback really is the price. Also, as my wife pointed out, if it's true Japanese cuisine, the chefs would never sit in a position that they would need to physically go over the cooking material/ingredients while preparing and cooking - impolite and unsanitary. The biggest problem was the wagyu which was like 4 slices. Incredibly overpriced for what it is. Go to Kyukaku for happy hour and you can get something much worth the money. I would go there for the experience though.",3,Small portion overpriced if you havent had anything similar then OK to try to impress your date if heshe also never experienced it I certainly wouldnt recommend you to take your Japanese friends there Service is good the ingredients are good But the drawback really is the price Also as my wife pointed out if its true Japanese cuisine the chefs would never sit in a position that they would need to physically go over the cooking materialingredients while preparing and cooking impolite and unsanitary The biggest problem was the wagyu which was like 4 slices Incredibly overpriced for what it is Go to Kyukaku for happy hour and you can get something much worth the money I would go there for the experience though,0
"Love the honey dipped fried chicken and the regular. Hate that they put sesame seeds on the waffles. =/ Wish they had Roscoe's waffle recipe.

"Came here the day before Thanksgiving. It was dead. I was with one other person and we were offered the tasting menu. We requested no beef/pork and they complied graciously. Maybe it was because nobody else was in the restaurant for half our meal but we got A LOT of (too much) food, more than 8 courses, and most everything was good or great. A couple dishes needed help (the guacamole and skate) and a couple were VERY good (duck lettuce wraps, ceviche). All in all, they treated us very well and our tasting menu for two with 2 beers and 3 wines came to $120. Really quite inexpensive for the ridiculous amount of (high quality) food we were served.",4,Came here the day before Thanksgiving It was dead I was with one other person and we were offered the tasting menu We requested no beefpork and they complied graciously Maybe it was because nobody else was in the restaurant for half our meal but we got A LOT of too much food more than 8 courses and most everything was good or great A couple dishes needed help the guacamole and skate and a couple were VERY good duck lettuce wraps ceviche All in all they treated us very well and our tasting menu for two with 2 beers and 3 wines came to 120 Really quite inexpensive for the ridiculous amount of high quality food we were served,0
"Almond is a great brunch place- for the food and the fact they take reservations (I LOVE planning). They start you with a little basket of mini biscuits which I always think is a nice, unexpected touch at breakfast (then again, I'm obsessed with bread baskets).

"I adopted my mix puppy from a shelter and they determined that she was a hound/bull dog mix. 50 lb as an adult guess for her future weight. Since she grew from 12lb to 30 lbs in 2 months, for curiosity, I decided to have her DNA tested. As it turned out, she is a Bull Mastiff Mix with staffordshire terrier (aka: Pit Bull), Plott Hound, french bull dog, chinook, shitzu and silky terrier. This could explain why she is growing quickly but also she is somewhat smaller than Mastiff's her current age (now 5 months) .

"Their chicken liver toast is heavenly and the ambiance is amazing. Their burger, however, was...meh. For all the hype it has gotten, I was disappointed. It was tasty at times, but not nearly as juicy as you would want it to be that the bun felt too...dry. The fries are good, mostly because of the crispy rosemary sprinkled over it.

"Non-traditional Thai food for good value. We arrived as part of a group of 4 on a Sunday around 6, and we were seated right away. There is a surprisingly fair amount of space in the back, so it can seat a fair number of small-ish groups. We split a papaya salad with sausage and fried pork rinds, ginger chicken, fried duck skin, and the fried eggplant with shrimp dish. The best dish was the fried duck skin dish--the duck was tender, but the highlight of the dish was the soup, which was sweet and delicious. The papaya salad was also very good and large-portioned, and the fried eggplant was also very good. Their Thai iced tea was also above average and not made from the powdered variety, which I always enjoy. It's not a particularly upscale place in terms of appearance, ambiance, or service, but it's definitely a place to come to enjoy cheap Thai food in small-ish groups that's slightly of the beaten path in Hell's Kitchen.",4,Nontraditional Thai food for good value We arrived as part of a group of 4 on a Sunday around 6 and we were seated right away There is a surprisingly fair amount of space in the back so it can seat a fair number of smallish groups We split a papaya salad with sausage and fried pork rinds ginger chicken fried duck skin and the fried eggplant with shrimp dish The best dish was the fried duck skin dishthe duck was tender but the highlight of the dish was the soup which was sweet and delicious The papaya salad was also very good and largeportioned and the fried eggplant was also very good Their Thai iced tea was also above average and not made from the powdered variety which I always enjoy Its not a particularly upscale place in terms of appearance ambiance or service but its definitely a place to come to enjoy cheap Thai food in smallish groups thats slightly of the beaten path in Hells Kitchen,0

"This place is totally magical inside. You could totally miss it when you walk by on the street, the exterior is subtle and the sign is tiny. Advice: look carefully, so that you actually do go inside and enjoy the delightful interior. There is a literal tree growing in the middle of the restaurant. Like a large tree that they built the restaurant around. So that's awesome. You feel like you're in some garden-sanctuary-greenhouse turned cafe, with the tree in the middle and all the lush plants around. The service is friendly but a bit confusing. Our waiter didn't speak much English and he pointed us towards the sandwich-soup-salad combo on the menu, instead of us each getting our own sandwiches. Because this combo comes with two sandwiches. I asked him if the combo sandwiches and salad were the same size as the regular order ones and he said yes, but when our order came they were half-sandwiches and the salad was tiny. With tax and tip we only paid $16 for lunch for two of us, but we left hungry. People's other plates looked incredible, and I think if we'd ordered right this would have been a 5-star experience.",4,This place is totally magical inside You could totally miss it when you walk by on the street the exterior is subtle and the sign is tiny Advice look carefully so that you actually do go inside and enjoy the delightful interior There is a literal tree growing in the middle of the restaurant Like a large tree that they built the restaurant around So thats awesome You feel like youre in some gardensanctuarygreenhouse turned cafe with the tree in the middle and all the lush plants around The service is friendly but a bit confusing Our waiter didnt speak much English and he pointed us towards the sandwichsoupsalad combo on the menu instead of us each getting our own sandwiches Because this combo comes with two sandwiches I asked him if the combo sandwiches and salad were the same size as the regular order ones and he said yes but when our order came they were halfsandwiches and the salad was tiny With tax and tip we only paid 16 for lunch for two of us but we left hungry Peoples other plates looked incredible and I think if wed ordered right this would have been a 5star experience,0

"This huge food emporium is impressive in sheer size and thoroughness of products available...there's anything you might think of when you think of Italy, in both prepared / ready to eat and grocery, prepared or raw/ready to prepare. I think this place is a little over-the-top though due to shameless shilling of the sponsor country, and I don't find it easy to navigate during peak rush hours. The food is delish though--so far I've eaten at the fish counter, the roasted meats counter, the coffee bar, and the chocolate/confections bar. Everything is well-made and tastes great; BUT this is a place for expense accounts only (does anyone even have one of these anymore??).

"This is embarrassing, but I live VERY close to Royale. Close enough that I felt pretty lame for taking so long to pop in.. it seemed so nondescript and unassuming, anytime we thought about going out for food, instead of staying close to home, we would always plan to leave the quiet pastures of Avenue C for the rough and tumble world to the west. What an error in judgment. I love me a delicious burger, and it's true, the Royale burger is deeeeelicious. Like, cot DAMN that's a good burger. It was so good that I'm tempted to make the 3000th Pulp Fiction reference on this page. Seated immediately on a quiet Friday night, ordered up a couple beers, and perused the 5"" x 7"" double-sided, laminated menu (one side beers, one side food). We both had Bacon Royales with cheese, and split a side of fries and onion rings. The burgers were cooked perfectly medium rare, juicy and delicious, crispy char on the ourside and pink on the inside, oozing with melted cheese and thick-cut, crunchy bacon. The bun was of the dark golden brown sesame seed variety, maligned by some of my friends as too large, too dense, too dry... detracting from the delicious beef flavor. I personally didn't think it was the world's most amazing bun, but it certainly wasn't a disaster and overall the burger was still fanfreakingtastic. I can't believe that it took me this long to find one of my favorite burgers in NYC, and it was basically next door to my apartment. My dining companion more or less made fun of me the entire night for being so slow to discover it.

"Yelp's ""Meh, I've experienced better"" fits just right for this place. We went to Little Italy knowing not to expect the best Italian food the city had to offer, but having visited Little Italy before and having a great experience, we were hoping to get lucky again. We decided to stop at Pellegrino's because of the great reviews. It was really cold out, we didn't feel like wandering around and finding a a place. The decor and atmosphere was terrible. First of all, the place is small and the tables are packed in tight. In combination with this, the place is filled with tourists. No locals from what I could tell. So, packed like sardines with other tourists. Not ideal. The dining room was so off. It seemed designed to be more of a gallery or retail store than a restaurant. The lights in the ceilings didn't match each other (florescent, iridescent). Everything was covered in really tacky Valentine's Day decor (cheap streamers and cardboard hearts, rope lights, etc.) This is a red flag for me. Italian food is a staple for V-day - you shouldn't have to push so hard. Plus, Italians are supposed to know romance. I'm pretty sure seduction is their main export. This was so tacky. I even thought the flowers on the table were fabric. I was so sure I removed them from the table. They weren't. Not sure what that means. Also, the kitchen doors were dominant in the rear of the restaurant and the bright lights from the kitchen permeated the dining room and made the atmosphere even worse. The wine was good. We really enjoyed that. The food was only mediocre. I was not impressed, it seemed to lack flavor. There were way too many employees there and they all covered the spectrum of Italian-American stereotypes. It was very crowded with owners and waiters. However, I noticed everyone bussing the tables and in the kitchen were hispanic. Not shocking, but not what I expected in Little Italy.

"Wow. Period. Delish. So good. What a great dining experience. I'm a big fan of the mom and pop places and happy to support these guys. This was like grandma's polish cooking at it's best (this coming from someone who isn't Polish). If you peak in the back towards the kitchen, you'll see the awesome older woman rocking out all the dishes. She's awesome and so is her food. When you go there (and you will) be prepared to wait. The place is a tiny, narrow hole in the wall with only about 10 tables in the entire place. Hopefully the weather isn't too bad out because there is barely any room to wait inside. There's a great limited menu with prices that will blow you away. My friend and I ate 2 entrees plus a dessert for only $25 TOTAL. That's right, TOTAL. My friend ordered the polish platter which included 3 piergies (1 meat, 1 potato, 1 cheese), a piece of kielbasa, 1 stuffed cabbage, mashed potatoes and bigos. A really nice amount of food for only $9 and it came with an assortment of red cabbage salad, white cabbage salad and carrot salad. Delish. I ordered the stuffed cabbage plate that came with the same salad assortment. I opted to change out the plain potatoes for fried potato dumplings and glad I did. The stuffed cabbage rolls were about half a pound each. Huge. Delish.

"Hands down the BEST Thai I have had. Dishes are flavorful, robust, and full of spunk. My friend tells me folks visiting from Thailand rave about this world renowned spot so you know it is on point. The service is sketchy but who cares- the price is right and the food is amazing. Egg roll appetizer came with an amazing dipping sauce. Yum! The chicken and shrimp dumplings were good and the dipping sauce made it much much better (the waitress said it is their soy sauce). I had a soup with coconut, chicken and mushroom. Divine. Extremely flavorful. Also tried the Drunken noodles. The basil and chili flavor is immense and to die for. My sister had the chicken pad thai and loved it. Yes it is in Queens so stop being a such a Manhattan-ite and go. This really is the best I have tasted. Plus the menu has pictures of all of their dishes so you see before you try. I have seen old pictures and Sri prai phai has undergone renovations.

"This place is quite lovely on the inside -- the light colors are a refreshing change from the typical dark wood and exposed brick BK standard. It also hasn't blown up yet, so my companion and I had no wait on a Friday night, which was fantastic. The service was attentive but maybe a bit disorganized -- the hostess (perhaps proprietor) told us about wine specials and took our order, but didn't pick up the plates or bring the check, which is perhaps why our drinks were left off and I was faced with the ugly task of telling them that my bill should in fact be higher :( The pork belly main was really tasty! quail eggs were cute and hard-boiled. I would love if they were soft boiled or poached but I have trouble poaching chicken eggs, so I'm guessing quail eggs would be a challenge not to over-do in a busy kitchen. Would get again after I tried everything else, though be warned that it is literally a bowl of protein and not much filler. The small plates/medium plates are definitely decent-sized and I think all are veg, which is great. Three would probably be fine to share between two people. It would be cool to have a veg entree though I guess that may not fit into the authentic Franco-Vietnamese vision. The crisp on the lemongrass tofu cubes was nice but unfortunately covered any lemongrass flavor and left you with standard fried tofu. However, the pickled elements made the other tofu dish fantastic. NB that the pho and bahn mi sandwiches are for lunch only, though I heard the chef may be amenable to change if there is enough clamor (hinthint). Definitely coming back to try the lunch menu! but only if a fan has been added :)",4,This place is quite lovely on the inside the light colors are a refreshing change from the typical dark wood and exposed brick BK standard It also hasnt blown up yet so my companion and I had no wait on a Friday night which was fantastic The service was attentive but maybe a bit disorganized the hostess perhaps proprietor told us about wine specials and took our order but didnt pick up the plates or bring the check which is perhaps why our drinks were left off and I was faced with the ugly task of telling them that my bill should in fact be higher The pork belly main was really tasty quail eggs were cute and hardboiled I would love if they were soft boiled or poached but I have trouble poaching chicken eggs so Im guessing quail eggs would be a challenge not to overdo in a busy kitchen Would get again after I tried everything else though be warned that it is literally a bowl of protein and not much filler The small platesmedium plates are definitely decentsized and I think all are veg which is great Three would probably be fine to share between two people It would be cool to have a veg entree though I guess that may not fit into the authentic FrancoVietnamese vision The crisp on the lemongrass tofu cubes was nice but unfortunately covered any lemongrass flavor and left you with standard fried tofu However the pickled elements made the other tofu dish fantastic NB that the pho and bahn mi sandwiches are for lunch only though I heard the chef may be amenable to change if there is enough clamor hinthint Definitely coming back to try the lunch menu but only if a fan has been added,0

"Just because I am Asian snapping pictures all the time, it doesn't mean I am a tourist. However, the last two trips to New York City, I found myself right smack in the tourist trap called Times Square. There's just too many people in Times Square especially on days to New Year's Eve. Everything is expensive. Even a small sack of nuts costs $5. Getting a Starbuck receipt for $6 for mocha and pumpkin bread all of a sudden seemed cheap. Further, it's a struggle to find places to eat here without having to wait forever and not stand in line. Junior's is in the midst of it all and it's a familiar place. It's just a diner type place known for their cheesecake. They serve decent okay diner type food and I happen to not mind it. It's busy like every other place around it. Yesterday, there was a long wait for breakfast, but we got a table in a mere 15 minutes despite the scary amount of people waiting for a table. Breakfast food was fine. Nothing exceptional but it wasn't bad at all. The omelettes were looking fluffy and fat. The poached eggs looked proper. Corned beef was yummy. The pancakes looked like a pancake. We all ate and had no complaint. They serve coffee in a wide big mug and I didn't run out of coffee with my meal. The service was also good despite it being insanely busy. I had dinners here in the past and it was okay too. I had burgers mostly. I also had their matzo ball soup and I love it. It may not be the best, but it is available and decent. The broth was comforting and love the noodle in it. The price was astronomical. Yet again, Times Square, New York City. They had to rape you cuz they can. $100 breakfast for 3 adults and 2 kids...I'd say that was spendy for just okay foods. People come here for cheesecake. I come there because it's easy and generally pretty fast. The cheesecake line at their bakery could go out the door. After today, I would be happy to go home and not stand in line for anything for awhile. I have done my fair share standing in line for toilet, cabs, or foods in these four days than anything else.

Really adorable place for cheap italian food in the city. Excellent place to come for a date- the atmosphere is super quaint and intimate. The dishes are ridiculously cheap for the quality you are getting. The crostini was excellent- covered in fresh cheeses and delicious tomatoes. The pasta dishes all ranged from about 9-15 dollars. The menu has a million options so it is pretty hard to chose. I tried a spicy dish with bacon and chopped garlic- it was excellent. My boyfriend had an anchovie pasta that he also loved. They also have an excellent cheap wine list that pairs nicely with the pastas. Overall- excellent place for a fun and cheap date downtown with unlimited pasta options!,4,Really adorable place for cheap italian food in the city Excellent place to come for a date the atmosphere is super quaint and intimate The dishes are ridiculously cheap for the quality you are getting The crostini was excellent covered in fresh cheeses and delicious tomatoes The pasta dishes all ranged from about 915 dollars The menu has a million options so it is pretty hard to chose I tried a spicy dish with bacon and chopped garlic it was excellent My boyfriend had an anchovie pasta that he also loved They also have an excellent cheap wine list that pairs nicely with the pastas Overall excellent place for a fun and cheap date downtown with unlimited pasta options,0
Initially I was going to get the burgundy color one but they didn't have my size. I am glad I got the blue instead. As it was a nice purchase. It doesn't look like the picture provided by the seller. Nor does it look like something I included in my picture in this review. However its just a nice sky blue colored sweater. Its 100% cotton and didn't irritate my skin. Plus the price point of the sweater was nice as many sweater similar can cost much more. I did receive this product at a discounted price for my review. However this is one of those products that even if I didn't get a discount I would think it was a nice purchase. Just a heads up for style purpose. If you like the modern and slim fit than the sizing should be normal. I got my size and it fit just right. Not sure how it will come out after I wash it though. If you like your sweaters to fit a little loser than get a size up. That's my suggestion and input.,5,Initially I was going to get the burgundy color one but they didnt have my size I am glad I got the blue instead As it was a nice purchase It doesnt look like the picture provided by the seller Nor does it look like something I included in my picture in this review However its just a nice sky blue colored sweater Its 100 cotton and didnt irritate my skin Plus the price point of the sweater was nice as many sweater similar can cost much more I did receive this product at a discounted price for my review However this is one of those products that even if I didnt get a discount I would think it was a nice purchase Just a heads up for style purpose If you like the modern and slim fit than the sizing should be normal I got my size and it fit just right Not sure how it will come out after I wash it though If you like your sweaters to fit a little loser than get a size up Thats my suggestion and input,0
"I don't typically give five stars, and let me preface it by saying that it's really a review of ONE meal and THREE dishes on the menu in particular. I've been to Perilla before and while the food has been good (3-4 stars depending on the dish) and ambiance decent, I was never really blown away. We may have just gotten a good night on the most recent visit, but what amazing dishes! So here's the deal - GO here, try the meatballs, and try these other dishes and hopefully you'll be very happy. In particular, the Baby Red Romain Salad, the Hand-Cut Tagliatelle with Lobster and Fra Diavolo sauce, and the Red Kuri Squash Agnolotti with the Truffles (definitely with the Truffles) were perfectly executed and tasted amazing! And again, we may have just gotten lucky but they were VERY generous with those truffles. Makes my mouth water just thinking about that meal. Oh, and I agree service can be slow, but if you sit at the bar there's no problem at all.

"Came here for the first time last year with my brother, and despite the lack of reservation-taking and the expected wait, I've been back numerous times. For starters, I love the almost classy underground atmosphere and the japanese shouts when you are getting seated. Appetizer: Always, always ALWAYS the pork buns. I actually like these better than Momofuku's, but both are fabulous. Ramen: The first time I was here, I had the Akamaru Modern ramen. Nice, thick, flavorful broth. Kept me intrigued for another visit. Every time after that, I got the Tori Ramen. I'm a fan of its thinner yet still flavorful broth, and I always request house-made hot sauce to go with it. I love spicy food. :) I recently went to Momofuku noodle bar, and it was yummy, but after Ippudo, I was underwhelmed. Their desserts always look promising, but after some yummy after dinner green tea, I'm ready to be rolled out... all the way to Sundaes and Cones 2 blocks away.

"Ippudo NY is damn close to the Ippudo in Tokyo. The noodles pack almost as much flavor and texture; the broth almost as beautiful and yummy. But Ippudo NY is also marred by some glaring problems. The wait sucks, the prices exorbitant, and the side dishes slightly above average. I would hate to stand in line for two hours amongst 20 people squeezed at the bar only to be disappointed by a bowl of $14 ramen. At Ippudo Tokyo, I could get ramen and a side of gyoza for less than nine bucks. But at Ippudo NY, I get a slightly inferior bowl of noodles without any sides, which would cost another ten or so dollars. Everyone raves about the pork buns. I say skip the damn dish and just get the ramen. Ipuddo's pork bun would never pass as acceptable at a chinese restaurant.

"How have I not reviewed Walter's yet? We live in the hood, and have been here on a handful of occasions for weekday lunches and weekend dinners. Consistently enjoyed great service, great drinks and terrific food. I admit, we've now tried -- or had friends/family who've tried -- much of the menu. The artichoke dip is fantastic; probably the best I've ever had and a big portion to boot. Vegetable sides vary by season, and I've thus far enjoyed both shredded brussels sprouts and roasted asparagus with parmesan. My boyfriend is a huge oyster fan, and consistently ranks Walter's oysters as top-notch in variety (they often have 6-7 different oysters available) and quality. Lobster pasta and burger are both awesome...and the fries are out-of-this-world good. The little touches make a big difference here, IMHO. The burger, for instance, is served garnished with pickled onions. Not a huge thing. But tasty as hell. Good call, Walter's. Service, for me, has been above and beyond. When our parents visited, we made reservations for the six of us on a Saturday night. They were slammed and we ended up waiting 20 minutes for our table. The manager offered up free drinks and a free order of artichoke dip while we waited at the bar. If only every restaurant was so considerate!! Of course, the place ain't perfect. If you have wealthy family members in town, this might be the spot to take them (assuming they foot the bill) because it is expensive. Like...$34 pasta expensive. We wish we could come more often, but the bill tends to be prohibitively pricey (also because, frankly, this restaurant brings out the glutton in us both). Layout and tables are kinda weird, and I think exacerbate the long waits that are inevitable during prime dining times. If they could only knock down a few walls and double the size of the dining room...we'd be all set.",4,How have I not reviewed Walters yet We live in the hood and have been here on a handful of occasions for weekday lunches and weekend dinners Consistently enjoyed great service great drinks and terrific food I admit weve now tried or had friendsfamily whove tried much of the menu The artichoke dip is fantastic probably the best Ive ever had and a big portion to boot Vegetable sides vary by season and Ive thus far enjoyed both shredded brussels sprouts and roasted asparagus with parmesan My boyfriend is a huge oyster fan and consistently ranks Walters oysters as topnotch in variety they often have 67 different oysters available and quality Lobster pasta and burger are both awesomeand the fries are outofthisworld good The little touches make a big difference here IMHO The burger for instance is served garnished with pickled onions Not a huge thing But tasty as hell Good call Walters Service for me has been above and beyond When our parents visited we made reservations for the six of us on a Saturday night They were slammed and we ended up waiting 20 minutes for our table The manager offered up free drinks and a free order of artichoke dip while we waited at the bar If only every restaurant was so considerate Of course the place aint perfect If you have wealthy family members in town this might be the spot to take them assuming they foot the bill because it is expensive Like34 pasta expensive We wish we could come more often but the bill tends to be prohibitively pricey also because frankly this restaurant brings out the glutton in us both Layout and tables are kinda weird and I think exacerbate the long waits that are inevitable during prime dining times If they could only knock down a few walls and double the size of the dining roomwed be all set,0

"If you're looking for an authentic but inexpensive Italian restaurant away from all the hustle and bustle of Little Italy, look no further. Come here for Meatball Monday, what a great deal! For $32, you get a 3 course meal and a glass of wine. Basically a steal especially for NYC standards. Of course there is a prix fixe menu you must choose from but there are plenty of delicious options. I had a glass of red wine, the Vitello (veal meatballs) with grilled ciabatta bread, meatball-filled ravioli with sauce, and the cioccolata chocolate truffles with vanilla sauce, whipped cream, and strawberries. The meat dishes were delicious but the truffles were a bit too sweet (even for me, the sugar queen). You could taste the sugar granules.

"Lucali is good but I'm not sure I'd go out of my way to come here. They have some sort of crazy following. You really gotta come here like 30 minutes before it opens to avoid that 2 hour wait or so. The pizza is solid and has really fresh ingredients. They don't have many options which is sometimes a good thing so they can focus on what matters. Just pizza. I loved the fresh cheese, shallots, garlic, basil, pepperoni. It's really filling because it's not exactly thin crusted by any means. Is it the best pizza I've ever had? Probably not, but it's worth a try for sure.",4,Lucali is good but Im not sure Id go out of my way to come here They have some sort of crazy following You really gotta come here like 30 minutes before it opens to avoid that 2 hour wait or so The pizza is solid and has really fresh ingredients They dont have many options which is sometimes a good thing so they can focus on what matters Just pizza I loved the fresh cheese shallots garlic basil pepperoni Its really filling because its not exactly thin crusted by any means Is it the best pizza Ive ever had Probably not but its worth a try for sure,0

"Contra's strengths lie in its affordable tasting menu ($55 for five courses), its creative, maybe unconventional ingredients, and its whimsical menu (changes daily), shrouding each diner with mystery and curiosity until arrival. That could be a hit or miss, depending on the night. Especially if you have strict dietary restrictions/allergies, definitely call ahead to make sure they can accommodate you. The menu on July 18, 2014 was: tomato, cucumber, eggplant clam, scallop, cabbage, leek sweetbreads, beans, currants wild chamomile, strawberry, olive oil yogurt, grains, seeds Like everyone else said, definitely order the bread for an additional $3. It's absolutely worth it, and the butter was melt-in-your-mouth amazing! Good thing I learned that it was goat's milk butter later, because I normally don't eat it. As my first time having sweetbread (I believe ours was thymus), it wasn't as horrific as I imagined. The blackcurrant surprisingly masked the earthy/gamey taste very well. My friend and I did end up eating everyone else's sweetbread though haha. The chamomile ice cream with strawberry reduction sauce was lovely, and I was impressed by how well they teased out the fragrance of the chamomile ice cream. The (buckwheat?) yogurt with grains and seeds was my absolute favorite though! On the night that we came, the desserts stood out more than the main dishes. I'll be sure to give Contra another try, but I hope they improve their service (cold and hurried) and spacing between courses (we had empty dishes that weren't cleared for over 20 minutes and there were a few long gaps). Also, the portions are on the smaller side - if I hadn't gobbled up everyone else's sweetbreads, I probably would have left hungry. 3.5 stars.

"I've been here for both lunch and dinner, and I'm a big fan. There are plenty of thai restaurants in the area, but in terms of quality of food, price, ambience - this is by far my favorite. My favorite ""regular"" item is the spicy basil dish - the sauce adds just the perfect dose of sweetness. The tom yum soup is amazing.

"I heard great things about Kefi so I went there with some friends in Dec 2008. Great ambience, but that's about it. The dining experience was one I'd like to forget, but unfortunately never will. My girlfriend's pasta came with a plastic cap in it. A freakin PLASTIC CAP!!!! After we complain, the waitress brings the 3 of us complimentary drinks. OK, sort of cool. But, then when we get the bill, and they have the audacity to charge us for the Plastic Cup Pasta dish AND charge us for the so-called ""sorry-I-put-freakin-plastic-cap-in-your-pasta"" complimentary drinks. What kind of service is this?! I'm sorry, this is totally unacceptable. You can't make that kind of mistake at a restaurant. And if you do, someone should be getting fired or at least reprimanded. And the manager should have come over and personally apologized in person. How about taking some responsibility for the dining experience that your staff is providing its customers?

"I love this hyper focused trend that seems to be all the rage downtown these days. A shop dedicated to zepolis. A shop dedicated to pastrami. A shop dedicated to Mac and Cheese. A shop dedicated to meatballs. And lets face it: meatballs, which are possibly god's greatest gift to man, are well worth the singular focused treatment. AND SO SAYETH THE LORD. THOUGH SHALT ROUNDLY SHAPE THINE GRINDED MEAT. AND IT WAS GOOD. But even old Gee Oh Dee never had meatballs like this. Otherwise he would have sayeth that it was great. Because these are the balls to beat these days. (No meatball Shop review is complete without a line like ""these are the balls to beat"". Come on.) I had the beef balls with mozzarella and the spicy meat sauce on a hero. Zounds! Amazing. Perfect even. The specialty balls where Cinco De Mayo related. Pork balls with tequila, jalapenos, and tortillas crumbled inside served with its own special salsa. It wasn't as epic as the straight up beef balls, but I loved the playful attempt here. And it was still pretty damn good. You can get your balls on a hero, on a bun, as a ball slider (!) and over pasta or mashed potatoes. The aforementioned potatoes are worthy of comment, because HOLY HELL. They're like 80% butter and 20% potato. Making them 100% awesome. But it's their big, juicy balls that are the main attraction.

"This is a review for the Truck (do they have more than one?), it's parked on 49th and 3rd Ave. on Friday's. I osciliated between 4 and 5 stars for Wafels and Dinges and ultimately decided to give it 5. Why? See, I'm not a big sweets fan. Really, I'm not! Read my other reviews, my general complaint for most foods is that it's too sweet. Even foods not really intended to be sweet, I will find overly saccharine. With that said let's get one thing out of the way : Wafels and Dinges is sugar in hyperdrive. I mean, your teeth will hurt, jaw will start chattering type of sugar overload. I had a wafel this morning and I think I ate it too quickly, my stomach hurt for like an hour. (First world problems I know) Wafels and Dingles is a food truck that specializes mainly in serving wafels. Yes, the type you normally order at a diner and pour syrup on. Except Wafels and Dinges will indulge your childish sensibilities and allow you to choose as many ""dinges"" (toppings) as you want for a mere $2. I chose a Brussels waffle today and topped it with spekulos, banana, strawberry, whipped cream, and chocolate fudge. Needless to say this is the quite possibly the sweetest thing on earth... but I loved it. Every mouth watering bite, the whipped cream mixing with the fudge backed by a bite of fresh fruit all on top of a crispy waffle coated with spekuloos. A wafel with unlimited dinges will run you $7, I know... steep for breakfast but seriously come here and try it. So why did I ultimately decide to give this 5 stars even though it's way out of the price range of a normal breakfast and really doesn't have protein to speak of? It's just mind bendingly delicious. It turns a self admitted non-sweets eater into a bumbling mess of shame (with a tummy ache) every Friday morning. Wafels and Dinges is the shit. But go easy on the toppings. I think Whipped cream, spekuloos and fudge was overkill. Did I mention they coat the thing with powdered sugar regardless of what you pick? Also they have ice cream?

"I gave this Peet dryer 5 stars because it performs in exactly the way I expected it to when I purchased it. We have basketball shoes that need to be dried each night after practice and tennis shoes that have been out in the snow and gotten soaked. The Peet Dryer has a button so I can choose heat or no heat. It also has a dial that allows me to choose how long it will run. The timer goes up to 240 minutes. The first time I used the dryer, I couldn't really tell if it was working. I could hardly feel any air moving out of the shoe extenders. I was wondering if it would work... it did. It's easy to use and fairly quiet, so I can keep it plugged in and doing it's drying job in the entry way of our home and not be aware that it's running. The unit is pretty lightweight, but not cheaply made. The vertical extenders that I put the shoes on are thick plastic and removable. The center fan/digital unit is attached to the base.

Taim is a place. They serve and make falafel balls and then they put them in things and then you eat them and then you finish them and then you don't eat them any more. For this they are good and so I recommend them for to go there and eat their falafels. If you don't want their falafels you can go to mammouns and eat their meats and/or falafels and have a different experience but I think not as good so therefore don't do that. I give them four out of eight falafel balls.

"Cathy Johnson was busy helping out the family restaurant and trying out new things to add to the menu to think about the TV production that is coming to their small town in Virginia. The whole town seemed to be pretty much excited except her. Her heart has been broken by her high school sweetheart, a relationship that ended in a disaster. The last thing she needs was to become star struck. Until she crossed path with the sexy and charming Greg Moran who arrives in Dogwood together with the rest of the cast and crew of Bittersweet. They had this crazy connection together, but if Cathy was careful to get her emotions in tangle, Greg can be pretty much fickle minded. He can be all in, and then all of a sudden, he was nowhere in sight. He can be interested now, and then appear disinterested the next time. He had some secrets of his own, that I wanted to know. I would have loved it more if he gets his own POV. But I was stuck with Cathy, and her thoughts weren't that bad. There were a lot of bumps before their happy ever after and there were times when youd just wanted to ask Greg if he really wants Cathy, or if both of them wanted this to work There were times when I got frustrated with the hot-then-cold Greg just about everything seems to be perfect, suddenly theyd be back to square one, but still I found this book romantic and endearing. I love Cathy, and her friend Max and Hal they were a great bunch, and both of her friends are there to catch her every time she falls. Greg was hard to love, but you couldn't resist his charms, so please don't blame Cathy. This is my first Sunday James read, and it was okay. I look forward for the next book in the series and cant wait to read whats next for this two!",4,Cathy Johnson was busy helping out the family restaurant and trying out new things to add to the menu to think about the TV production that is coming to their small town in Virginia The whole town seemed to be pretty much excited except her Her heart has been broken by her high school sweetheart a relationship that ended in a disaster The last thing she needs was to become star struck Until she crossed path with the sexy and charming Greg Moran who arrives in Dogwood together with the rest of the cast and crew of Bittersweet They had this crazy connection together but if Cathy was careful to get her emotions in tangle Greg can be pretty much fickle minded He can be all in and then all of a sudden he was nowhere in sight He can be interested now and then appear disinterested the next time He had some secrets of his own that I wanted to know I would have loved it more if he gets his own POV But I was stuck with Cathy and her thoughts werent that bad There were a lot of bumps before their happy ever after and there were times when youd just wanted to ask Greg if he really wants Cathy or if both of them wanted this to work There were times when I got frustrated with the hotthencold Greg just about everything seems to be perfect suddenly theyd be back to square one but still I found this book romantic and endearing I love Cathy and her friend Max and Hal they were a great bunch and both of her friends are there to catch her every time she falls Greg was hard to love but you couldnt resist his charms so please dont blame Cathy This is my first Sunday James read and it was okay I look forward for the next book in the series and cant wait to read whats next for this two,0

"Nothing here was bad...the food, the service, the cute little rooms-all of it was good, but I wasn't blown away by anything. If your typical meals consist of Olive Garden, Red Lobster and/or other chain restaurants, cruise buffets or church potlucks, you'll be blown away by the food here. But if you're a bit more discretionary, you might be a little disappointed. Hourglass' menu consisted of a lot of ""specials"" which were each xerox'd hand-written full page descriptions....it was a little irritating shifting through a half a ream of colored paper.

"This review is way overdue, but Minca definitely deserves to be reviewed. The review below is from a blog post I wrote shortly after visiting (back when I still ate meat on occasion). ----- Minca Ramen on a Sunday. We arrived at 12:30pm and were seated immediately. It started to get a little crowded about 20 minutes later. Hidden away in Alphabet City, Minca is a teensy tiny ramen shop (even smaller than Totto Ramen). The space feels authentic and comforting. They had some weird music playing - it sounded like it should be the soundtrack for an old school Nintendo game. We grabbed one of the window seats facing E 5th St. It was beautiful out. If we can't sit outside, at least we get a view of the street. Gorgeous weather, mellow neighborhood. At Minca, you can customize your ramen with thick, thin, wavy wheat, whole wheat and bean noodles. The menu also includes noodle recommendations if you can't make up your mind. We were tempted by the gyoza, but decided to stick to ramen. Someone seated near us ordered the shrimp gyoza, and it looked pretty legit. J ordered the Spicy Vegetable Miso Ramen with wavy wheat noodles ($13), which included fried tofu and vegetables for toppings. The corn and cabbage were a little unusual, but tasty with the broth. Light spiciness, intense miso flavor. This was much more miso-flavored than some ramen places. I didn't try the wavy noodles, but J enjoyed the big mouthfuls of noodles that he could really bite into. There were a lot of noodles in that bowl. A LOT. I couldn't decide between the Minca (soy sauce, pork and chicken broth) and the Basic (salt and roast garlic, pork broth). Both had been recommended in top ramen articles on foodie blogs. I ordered the Minca Sio ($10.50), which seemed like the perfect compromise. Minca Sio has the salt and garlic flavor AND the mixed pork and chicken broth. Win, win! My ramen looked like a stick of butter had melted in the broth (in a good way). Rich, creamy broth packed with burnt garlic flavor. Minca's garlic puts Hide-Chan's black garlic to shame. Disclaimer: I'm a garlic lover, so I was in garlic heaven, but this garlicky broth is not for everyone. I'm glad I got the thin noodles. Good texture, good balance of noodles and broth. Let's talk about the char siu. Pretty sure my eyes lit up as soon as I tasted the char siu. Lightly marinated. So tender and flavorful. Oh, and the fatty bits melted in my mouth. I sometimes get weirded out by really fatty char siu (like Totto Ramen's), but Minca's char siu was delish. Huge pieces with a good balance of tender meat and fat (!!!). The broth on its own wasn't that full of porky goodness, but the generous topping of char siu definitely met my porky goodness quota for ramen. The egg was on the chewy side, seemed a little overdone. Good soy sauce flavor though.",5,This review is way overdue but Minca definitely deserves to be reviewed The review below is from a blog post I wrote shortly after visiting back when I still ate meat on occasion Minca Ramen on a Sunday We arrived at 1230pm and were seated immediately It started to get a little crowded about 20 minutes later Hidden away in Alphabet City Minca is a teensy tiny ramen shop even smaller than Totto Ramen The space feels authentic and comforting They had some weird music playing it sounded like it should be the soundtrack for an old school Nintendo game We grabbed one of the window seats facing E 5th St It was beautiful out If we cant sit outside at least we get a view of the street Gorgeous weather mellow neighborhood At Minca you can customize your ramen with thick thin wavy wheat whole wheat and bean noodles The menu also includes noodle recommendations if you cant make up your mind We were tempted by the gyoza but decided to stick to ramen Someone seated near us ordered the shrimp gyoza and it looked pretty legit J ordered the Spicy Vegetable Miso Ramen with wavy wheat noodles 13 which included fried tofu and vegetables for toppings The corn and cabbage were a little unusual but tasty with the broth Light spiciness intense miso flavor This was much more misoflavored than some ramen places I didnt try the wavy noodles but J enjoyed the big mouthfuls of noodles that he could really bite into There were a lot of noodles in that bowl A LOT I couldnt decide between the Minca soy sauce pork and chicken broth and the Basic salt and roast garlic pork broth Both had been recommended in top ramen articles on foodie blogs I ordered the Minca Sio 1050 which seemed like the perfect compromise Minca Sio has the salt and garlic flavor AND the mixed pork and chicken broth Win win My ramen looked like a stick of butter had melted in the broth in a good way Rich creamy broth packed with burnt garlic flavor Mincas garlic puts HideChans black garlic to shame Disclaimer Im a garlic lover so I was in garlic heaven but this garlicky broth is not for everyone Im glad I got the thin noodles Good texture good balance of noodles and broth Lets talk about the char siu Pretty sure my eyes lit up as soon as I tasted the char siu Lightly marinated So tender and flavorful Oh and the fatty bits melted in my mouth I sometimes get weirded out by really fatty char siu like Totto Ramens but Mincas char siu was delish Huge pieces with a good balance of tender meat and fat The broth on its own wasnt that full of porky goodness but the generous topping of char siu definitely met my porky goodness quota for ramen The egg was on the chewy side seemed a little overdone Good soy sauce flavor though,0
"I like this place a lot. In the wasteland of mediocrity that is the Upper East Side, places like this stand out. The appetizers were great. The wine was good and cheap. They fucked up my steak really badly... overcooked all the taste out of it. But they gave me a $7 discount for it, and a coupon for a free dessert. Very friendly people. Will definitely go back.

"This place is all about offal, and they make zero attempt to cater to those who don't eat it. The hot dog was quite lackluster, and came with *nothing* on it, for $4.50. Friends enjoyed the heart, but the $10 price tag on that is rather high, considering how incredibly cheap it is to buy heart. The $6 dessert tarts were *terrible*, worse than what you'd expect out of some random greasy spoon in the midwest. All in all, if I want meat, I'll go next door to Fette Sau. If I want a deep fried hotdog, I can go Crif Dog (where they are significantly better and cheaper), and there are a million options for sausages.

"The Ontario Gen II SP-50 is a splendid knife with a blade of 5160 carbon steel. It cuts, slashes, dices and slices, all with astounding results, but like most blades in its class, it's heavy. And it's not stainless steel, meaning it will rust. Is it worth the money? Easily, and then some. Is it better than the RTAK II? Well, maybe. I haven't been able to decide. The SP-50 has better blade steel (the RTAK II having 1095 carbon), but the RTAK II has better grips and a way better sheath. And, to me, performance is about the same. The blade finish is better with the SP-50. I'd go with the RTAK II all things considered.",4,The Ontario Gen II SP50 is a splendid knife with a blade of 5160 carbon steel It cuts slashes dices and slices all with astounding results but like most blades in its class its heavy And its not stainless steel meaning it will rust Is it worth the money Easily and then some Is it better than the RTAK II Well maybe I havent been able to decide The SP50 has better blade steel the RTAK II having 1095 carbon but the RTAK II has better grips and a way better sheath And to me performance is about the same The blade finish is better with the SP50 Id go with the RTAK II all things considered,0
"Along with Bareburger this, I don't even know what to call it, is the biggest ripoff you can have the misfortune of going to. Let me start with the appearance of this place. The back yard area has some good ideas and then it jus gets confused and loses its way. They should of stayed with the wooden theme but then decided to get lazy and throw in some random metal back yard tables from Costco or Home Depot and seats that are too short for the tables. Also the least they can do is cover up the side of the yard so we don't have to stare at the neighbor's garbage and old furniture while eating. The service was also mediocre as we only saw out waiter 2 times and one of them she was borderline depressing. The food was ridiculous. The crostinis are $6 crackers with cold cuts and cheese on them. Basically, you know.......shit you can make at home! Our Crostini had goat cheese, jam and 4 pieces of peperoni on it. It looked like something out of a lunchables box that a five year old can make. That is when I made a ground breaking realization! Almost everything on the menu is something you can make at home. I can probably buy a toaster and start my own Il Bambino 2. Besides the $6 cheese and crackers there is NO WAY that anyone in Astoria should pay $11 for a Panini. You pay $8 for a Panini in Manhattan paying more then that is RIDICULOUS. There is nothing great about this place. If you want pay well for good food just go to Zenon next door and forget this makeshift, overpriced lemonade stand.",1,Along with Bareburger this I dont even know what to call it is the biggest ripoff you can have the misfortune of going to Let me start with the appearance of this place The back yard area has some good ideas and then it jus gets confused and loses its way They should of stayed with the wooden theme but then decided to get lazy and throw in some random metal back yard tables from Costco or Home Depot and seats that are too short for the tables Also the least they can do is cover up the side of the yard so we dont have to stare at the neighbors garbage and old furniture while eating The service was also mediocre as we only saw out waiter 2 times and one of them she was borderline depressing The food was ridiculous The crostinis are 6 crackers with cold cuts and cheese on them Basically you knowshit you can make at home Our Crostini had goat cheese jam and 4 pieces of peperoni on it It looked like something out of a lunchables box that a five year old can make That is when I made a ground breaking realization Almost everything on the menu is something you can make at home I can probably buy a toaster and start my own Il Bambino 2 Besides the 6 cheese and crackers there is NO WAY that anyone in Astoria should pay 11 for a Panini You pay 8 for a Panini in Manhattan paying more then that is RIDICULOUS There is nothing great about this place If you want pay well for good food just go to Zenon next door and forget this makeshift overpriced lemonade stand,0

We had Pavlova and Lamington for dessert - Pavlova is very light and decadent, and Lamington is a heavier and sweeter dessert but both are very tasty.

"I tried the merguez (lamb sausage), beef and feta ""cigars"", and mint iced tea today. All were delicious. I can't wait to return to try the lemon chicken over couscous. The sausage sandwich is delicious. I can't be too effusive, because I am not a huge sausage lover. The sausage are nicely flavored, and the bread is perfect. I am not a big bread fan, but this bread is just as I like it...soft, flaky, flavorful. I think there should be one or two more sausages on it, and definitely more veggies. I got the hot sauce on top, and boy it was hot. I am good with hot food, and this made my nose run it was so hot! There are 3 hot sauces to choose from, so you don't need to be as masochistic as me. I felt like the fillings were skimpy, although tasted great. The tea perfectly compliments the food, so I would recommend you don't skip it. My only complaint is that $3 for an iced tea seems unreasonably high. It is delicious, but how about $1.50 or $2? The beef and feta ""cigars"" (basically borek, or phyllo rolls) are so good. They are $3 for 2. Great snack. They come on a few mixed greens. The sauce they pour over the rolls is wonderful. I always find it frustrating trying to find food trucks lately...they don't seem to park in the same spots all the time, and you have to be a socially networked Sherlock Holmes to track lunch down nowadays. Anyways, I found the truck on 38th and Broadway. I walked my lunch over to Bryant Park and enjoyed the beautiful weather with some great food in the park. Life is good.

"For all you gueros out there, allow this Mexican't boy to explain: Empanadas are Latin Hot Pockets. And like their American counterpoints, they are delicious, especially at Empanada Mama. Here they are served with the more typically Indian mint and tamarind chutneys, but it totally complements the crispy pastry shell, which come to think of, are similar to samosas. Also, the $18 ""medium"" pitcher of sangria could easily have served four people.

I can't decide if I like all the yelling from the staff which was a total shock on the first visit as it's personal when you enter and exit. Guessing when the place is full and buzzy it's less invasive.But overall the service, food and energy of this place is enough to keep me coming back.",4,Ramen Really really yummy Just like to reviews all say this is some good stuff We went early like for breakfast early on a Monday because they open at 11am and there wasnt a wait I cant decide if I like all the yelling from the staff which was a total shock on the first visit as its personal when you enter and exit Guessing when the place is full and buzzy its less invasiveBut overall the service food and energy of this place is enough to keep me coming back,0

"The wait wasn't bad at all for a Saturday. I wasnt exactly sure where they were going to seat us all, but eventually we were led through what it felt like a maze and the place was actually bigger than I thought. There's a downstairs - not sure if anyone is seated there though, and there's a side room as well - which is dumb you have to basically walk through the kitchen to get to. We ordered a medium pizza of Margarita Pizza with added Wild Mushrooms. It was delicious! But I have to say, service sucked. Our waitress was very rude, and I think the pizza was well over charged, $20 for a medium - are you crazy?

"High quality food and great prices, with an excellent buy ten get one free discount card. The breads and produce are always very fresh, and the pastries are very tasty as well. One shortcoming: this place can be a bit inconsistent. It seems they get somewhat overwhelmed by lunchtime crowds and when I've gone with a group, often someone's order gets lost, and the food can sometimes decline in quality (a ""prosciutto and spinach"" salad with limp, overdressed greens and hard pancetta instead of prosciutto.) All in all, great little spot, but probably best to come during the quieter hours.",4,High quality food and great prices with an excellent buy ten get one free discount card The breads and produce are always very fresh and the pastries are very tasty as well One shortcoming this place can be a bit inconsistent It seems they get somewhat overwhelmed by lunchtime crowds and when Ive gone with a group often someones order gets lost and the food can sometimes decline in quality a prosciutto and spinach salad with limp overdressed greens and hard pancetta instead of prosciutto All in all great little spot but probably best to come during the quieter hours,0
"Well I actually didn't eat at Mark but I picked up 10 sliders for a surprise engagement party for a girlfriend... I walked in and the place was very dive-ish. I liked the feel, very low key, but very St. Marks-ish. If that even is anything? They individually wrapped the sliders, which was awesome because it kept them warm. The sliders were great. They were cooked medium rare and I didn't even ask for them that way...however it is my fave for a burger!! The burgers were a perfect size- not too small and not too big. I was actually really impressed and happy with my slider pick up choice!

"I don't get this as often as I'd like to anymore because I'm hardly in the area, and I rarely get the chance to venture there. But the food is still as delicious as I remember it to be.

To all those people who complain about rude service and the magicians (yes it is magic) being mean, you guys are just slow wimps.

"This place is named for its main offering, the tarte flambee, which is the thinnest crust delicacy ever! We ate here twice, and the light, delicious main course felt more like a dessert. Try the traditional or the veggie and make sure to get the emmental cheese. Splurge and the top of the tarte menu will run you $13.

"I'm very so-so about this place. I arrived at 7pm on a Monday and there were already a ton of people waiting for tables. The restaurant is so small that you have to wait outside, which kinda stinks when it's really cold or raining. They won't seat you until your entire party is there, so even if it finally reaches your name on the waiting list, you still have to keep waiting. They're extremely fast at giving you your food, which is a plus, but they will also give you your check before you're even done eating to try to encourage fast turnover. Kind of annoying. The food is pretty bland. I will recommend the summer roll with shrimp. However, the duck with vermicelli was super bland. I would recommend trying other food there than the vermicelli.",2,Im very soso about this place I arrived at 7pm on a Monday and there were already a ton of people waiting for tables The restaurant is so small that you have to wait outside which kinda stinks when its really cold or raining They wont seat you until your entire party is there so even if it finally reaches your name on the waiting list you still have to keep waiting Theyre extremely fast at giving you your food which is a plus but they will also give you your check before youre even done eating to try to encourage fast turnover Kind of annoying The food is pretty bland I will recommend the summer roll with shrimp However the duck with vermicelli was super bland I would recommend trying other food there than the vermicelli,0

"I'm honestly not a BBQ expert, but I know good meat, and Fette Sau has it. My boyfriend and I got a total of 1.5lbs of meat. 1/2lb beef brisket, 1/2lb pork shoulder, and 1/2lb pork belly. We also got a large side of the German potato salad. The amount of meat we had was probably a little more than what we needed, especially given the fattiness of it all. But it was all so good! The beef brisket had the perfect balance of lean meat and fat. The pork belly was honestly probably a little fattier than what I like, but it's pork belly, so what do you expect. The pork shoulder wasn't as tasty as I would have liked, although the bbq sauce helps out a bit. Out of the 3 meats we had, I probably liked the beef brisket the best. It was definitely the most moist brisket I've ever had. Probably the worst part about Fette Sau is the line. We came around 9pm on a Saturday and waited maybe about 30-40 minutes. The plus is that you can get a drink at the bar while you wait in line. The only have one guy cutting and weighing the meats and one cashier. I'm sure if they had just one more person handling the meats, the line would move so much faster. Though it probably makes sense that they do that...no one really had to wait around for seats to open up, so I suppose it's the right balance anyways. Lastly, the prices are very reasonable given the quality. 1.5lbs of meat and one large side came out to $34, and we were VERY full.",4,Im honestly not a BBQ expert but I know good meat and Fette Sau has it My boyfriend and I got a total of 15lbs of meat 12lb beef brisket 12lb pork shoulder and 12lb pork belly We also got a large side of the German potato salad The amount of meat we had was probably a little more than what we needed especially given the fattiness of it all But it was all so good The beef brisket had the perfect balance of lean meat and fat The pork belly was honestly probably a little fattier than what I like but its pork belly so what do you expect The pork shoulder wasnt as tasty as I would have liked although the bbq sauce helps out a bit Out of the 3 meats we had I probably liked the beef brisket the best It was definitely the most moist brisket Ive ever had Probably the worst part about Fette Sau is the line We came around 9pm on a Saturday and waited maybe about 3040 minutes The plus is that you can get a drink at the bar while you wait in line The only have one guy cutting and weighing the meats and one cashier Im sure if they had just one more person handling the meats the line would move so much faster Though it probably makes sense that they do thatno one really had to wait around for seats to open up so I suppose its the right balance anyways Lastly the prices are very reasonable given the quality 15lbs of meat and one large side came out to 34 and we were VERY full,0

"After giving it another shot me and that same friend have decided this restaurant just isn't for us. This time we came for dinner. They had McKenzies Seasonal Reserve hard cider which was awesome. I ordered a glass of Rose for $8 that came in the smallest wine glass I've ever seen. I decided not to order another since they weren't standard sized. They also didn't have the oysters that were listed on their menu that night. My friend ordered the butternut squash ravioli with a sage cream sauce and almonds. I love rich foods, but this was way too heavy. The ravioli was very good but the sauce completely overpowered it, and instead of a small sprinkling of almonds they threw a TON of slivered almonds in there, which texturally also made the creamy sauce more paste-like. Bizarre. The lobster mac n cheese wasn't bad, but the cheese itself was creamy to the point of being liquidy and could have been seasoned better. Same with the cream of mushroom soup, I added some pepper and that helped. We both ordered the hanger steak, mine coming with mushroom ravioli. Both of our plates came out cold. Really? On top of that our steaks were totally unseasoned. We actually added salt and pepper to them, not that it helped much. My friends asparagus were undercooked. The ravioli were fine but nothing special, although the mushrooms sprinkled on top were fresh and delicious. I said in my last review that they're trying to be an upscale diner, but just like at a regular diner you wouldn't order steak and pasta and expect it to be great. Maybe their simpler dishes are better, but for the higher prices I think I'd rather just go to a greasy spoon joint instead.",2,After giving it another shot me and that same friend have decided this restaurant just isnt for us This time we came for dinner They had McKenzies Seasonal Reserve hard cider which was awesome I ordered a glass of Rose for 8 that came in the smallest wine glass Ive ever seen I decided not to order another since they werent standard sized They also didnt have the oysters that were listed on their menu that night My friend ordered the butternut squash ravioli with a sage cream sauce and almonds I love rich foods but this was way too heavy The ravioli was very good but the sauce completely overpowered it and instead of a small sprinkling of almonds they threw a TON of slivered almonds in there which texturally also made the creamy sauce more pastelike Bizarre The lobster mac n cheese wasnt bad but the cheese itself was creamy to the point of being liquidy and could have been seasoned better Same with the cream of mushroom soup I added some pepper and that helped We both ordered the hanger steak mine coming with mushroom ravioli Both of our plates came out cold Really On top of that our steaks were totally unseasoned We actually added salt and pepper to them not that it helped much My friends asparagus were undercooked The ravioli were fine but nothing special although the mushrooms sprinkled on top were fresh and delicious I said in my last review that theyre trying to be an upscale diner but just like at a regular diner you wouldnt order steak and pasta and expect it to be great Maybe their simpler dishes are better but for the higher prices I think Id rather just go to a greasy spoon joint instead,0

I'd never visited the taco truck, so didn't really know what to expect from this Mexican style with korean flavors, but i was more than impressed! I shared a variety of dishes with my friends and am looking forward to trying more. The meal started with a surprise from the chef, a sample of what they described as korean gnocchi. It was a savory rice cake with an incredible sauce that was so good that I also dipped my beef burrito in it. The burrito was filled with a really nice slice of beef and I ordered it with guacamole and kimchi friend rice which really made it quite a delight.

"I really, really love this place. It's really wallet friendly, and the noodles are the best! I usually get the beef tendon noodle, which is a tad sweet and spicy. They give a fair amount of tendons, which is good, since you don't want that much of that tough beef that usually is also in the bowl. The soup base seems to be made out of onions, carrots and tomatoes. What can go wrong with that?! I also like their seafood noodle soup. I really enjoy their soup bases. It's very flavorful, and the noodles are good. Their curry chicken noodle soup was also superb. I've had it once and it blew my taste buds away. I expected some watered down curry soup base, but the soup was creamy, and had a good curry flavor. It was kind of greasy, but most curries are. It is a really rich dish, so you may want to stay away if you're watching your weight. Bo Ky also has one of the best ducks. It's the one that has been marinated with that special dark sauce.

"Went for an impromptu dinner with husband and 5 month old baby on a Saturday night. They were incredibly accommodating both with our baby (getting us a great table outside--they moved one from inside to the lovely outdoor spot) and to my gluten allergy (celiac disease). I was thrilled that I could eat most things on the menu and that they knew that gluten/wheat was in things like soy sauce so I didn't have to explain myself. Hubby ordered chilled corn soup which was the weakest of everything we ordered. His criticism ; all the unexpected flavors (honeydew, crackerjack popcorn and smoky infusion) did not hold up together. I ordered the Tako taco. A blue corn taco with goat cheese and octopus. Very fresh, delicious. Entrees: I ordered salmon. It was a great cut of fish, cooked well on top of a bed of potatoes--basically homefry style in addition to asparagus laid on top. I ate it all. My critique: it was just too salty. I know that is the flavor palate these days but it overwhelmed a simple, fresh dish that could basically stand alone without the excess salt. My husband ordered the beef tenderloin. Excellent, flavorful and good texture. Good cut of meat. Great prices made even better by the BYOB policy. $50 tab--we stopped at the Bedford wine shop and got a great bottle of unoaked chardonnay for $8 before.

"After falling in love with the cocoron on Delancey, I persuaded my sister to try it out, and for some reason she went to this location instead, which was completely fine.

The food was amazing as usual and I feel like the menu expanded. We shared the green tea affogato and it was great, but word of warning - add the matcha to taste, you don't have to add everything!

I ordered the Pork Belly BLT. It is basically a normal BLT but instead replaced with Pork Bellt for the Bacon. IT WAS DELICIOUS. The Pork Belly was juicy and flavorful. I had it on a ciabatta roll and the bread the toasted to perfection. The bread and perfect amount of lettuce and tomato with a lot of pork belly all blended together perfectly with every bite. The chef puts this special glaze on the sandwich which was delicious. The overall meal was great. The sandwich was $12 and came out to $13 after tax. It comes with a side of Popcorn that was served in a little steel pot and also came with a bite size piece of brownie for a dessert. All in all it was worth the $13 cause the sandwich alone was the best Ive had in a while.,5,I ordered the Pork Belly BLT It is basically a normal BLT but instead replaced with Pork Bellt for the Bacon IT WAS DELICIOUS The Pork Belly was juicy and flavorful I had it on a ciabatta roll and the bread the toasted to perfection The bread and perfect amount of lettuce and tomato with a lot of pork belly all blended together perfectly with every bite The chef puts this special glaze on the sandwich which was delicious The overall meal was great The sandwich was 12 and came out to 13 after tax It comes with a side of Popcorn that was served in a little steel pot and also came with a bite size piece of brownie for a dessert All in all it was worth the 13 cause the sandwich alone was the best Ive had in a while,0

"Tasty pulled pork americanzied banh mi sandwich, but it's not big enough to justify paying $9. The pork just tasted like regular pulled pork with regular spicy mayo on top.

"I feel so bad. I feel like a hater. But I gotta say it - this place is overrated and expensive. I went here after a long day of work and they ran out of the glazed pork belly. OK fine, no big deal, but I panicked and ordered a random one off the menu (some fish sandwich) I was unimpressed. It was a puny sandwich. Maybe I just eat too much, but for $8.50, I could've walked to the Chipotle near by and gotten a burrito that weighs the same as a newborn baby. The sandwich was decently tasty (not 5 star good)... but I felt dirty eating it - I was ashamed that I had just paid $8.50 for ""banh mi"" that really should be twice as large and cost 1/2 of the price (especially at that size!).

Well, they charged me an extra dollar for the blueberry topping but I didnt care.. I also has a side of their grits with cheese. It was delicious but couldnt finish the grits. The banana nut pancake was amazing because the pancake had the banana and nut inside. I ate one of my husband's pancake with the blueberry topping which was delicious. We shared the egg benedict and that was very good. The yolk was runny, except if you like runny eggs, make sure to ask for it well done. I like runny eggs so that was great. It came warm, on top of their own biscuit with the hollandaise sauce and ham. Simply delicious. Would definitely recommend this place. One of the best pancakes, I've had in NY.

The atmosphere was gorgeous (definitely date-worthy), the service was attentive, the prices were very reasonable, and the food was good. One small issue that I had was that neither I nor my girlfriend could understand our Mexican waiter's broken English but luckily we made it through without any mistakes. The food wasn't the best I've ever had but it wasn't too disappointing either. The blueberry pancakes had plump fresh blueberries but mostly just in the middle and the home fries were slightly dry and luke warm but had a nice fresh flavor to them.

"It's been awhile since this cart won their Vendy awards for both the people's choice and the Vendy Cup for best food truck. In fact they won it in 2010. So it's been a long time since I've started drooling reading my friends reviews of this place and hearing it mentioned time again and again in the food blogs. A little more than a year since I first heard of this place, I finally made the trek to Astoria from Brooklyn in the freezing rain. The first thing I've discovered about this place is that for a cart, they have a phone number.... and that they actually answer it. My question to them? What time do they close? I'm sure some of you reading this might have wondered the same thing since Yelp doesn't provide this info. Not sure about the weekends but on weekdays, they close at 8:30PM. You're welcome. Arriving at the location of their cart, I discovered that they are situated right outside a supermarket with a parking lot. In fact, they are right besides the parking lot. Customer parking only the signage reads. Errr.... yep, I'm a customer alright. Maybe not today but probably another day. *wink* The guys manning this cart (Yep, I said guys. It seems to take three to run this thing even so far from the main part of the city) were really friendly and once they heard that we took a trip from Brooklyn just to get to them, they gave each of us an extra falafel to sample on top of the one that already comes with our platter. Hot off the fryer, without even a drop of sauce on it, this falafel is still among the best if not the best falafel I've tasted anywhere. Super crispy, crunchy texture on the outside with a nice contrasting moist softer interior in the inside, I would have happily ordered another batch of just these the next time I'm here. As for the main event, the vendy award winning platter, we took it to our dry interior of the car in the parking lot and enjoyed it with the pitty patter of rain drops sounding all around us. Ah.. the joy of free parking. Given a choice of yellow rice and basmati rice, I told the guy manning the cart to chose the one he prefer and he chose the basmati rice for me. So folks, you now know what they themselves would eat their platter with. Sadly, despite their name of King of Falafel and SHAWARMA, they ran out of shawarma to order so instead, I had the chicken instead which I was told was the better seller anyway. One bite and..... 53rd and 6th Halal Guys who? I mean I actually like the Halal Guys, but they taste very similar to some of the other carts in town, if only slightly better. But the King of Falafel and Shawarma, they have a flavor of their own. The chicken was nicely spiced and moist and was the rice. No dry overcooked stuff here. Even the Halal guys fail in this regard sometimes when they get too hectic. The white sauce and hot sauce (if you choose to put either one on the food that is), really bring extra flavor to what is already great tasting food, and it's helped by a mix of raw onions, green peppers, lettuce and what I assumed to be a pickled turnips to give it contrasting flavors and textures to each bite. I especially love the pickled turnips (?). So yes folks, I do believe they deserve their win. And yes, I believe they are worth the trek even from all the way from Brooklyn.

"I am ambivalent. For the prices of the meal, I felt like there should have been bread or something plopped onto the table for us to munch on while we waited. Since there wasn't, I was forced to make conversation with my boyfriend while being extremely hungry (amazing conversation did not ensue). The food definitely took some time. He ordered the chopped pork mustard barbecue sandwich with baked beans. When I think of barbecued pork I think saucy. This sandwich didn't really do it for me. We went back and forth over whether we liked the beans, since they were not traditional baked beans. Apparently we did, cause we ate them all. I ordered the roasted chicken. As my boyfriend said, chicken is just chicken. Which kinda sums it up. The roasted mushrooms and whipped potatoes that the chicken came on was super delicious. I would have liked more of that, rather than the large amount of chicken. We ended the meal with the chocolate cheesecake. This was the best part of the meal. UGH why did we share? I HATE to share. I wanted the whole thing. It looked a little funky upon arrival, but trust, it was tasty as hell.",3,I am ambivalent For the prices of the meal I felt like there should have been bread or something plopped onto the table for us to munch on while we waited Since there wasnt I was forced to make conversation with my boyfriend while being extremely hungry amazing conversation did not ensue The food definitely took some time He ordered the chopped pork mustard barbecue sandwich with baked beans When I think of barbecued pork I think saucy This sandwich didnt really do it for me We went back and forth over whether we liked the beans since they were not traditional baked beans Apparently we did cause we ate them all I ordered the roasted chicken As my boyfriend said chicken is just chicken Which kinda sums it up The roasted mushrooms and whipped potatoes that the chicken came on was super delicious I would have liked more of that rather than the large amount of chicken We ended the meal with the chocolate cheesecake This was the best part of the meal UGH why did we share I HATE to share I wanted the whole thing It looked a little funky upon arrival but trust it was tasty as hell,0

These clamps worked extremely well and have kept the tools in good working order for a very long time. I bought this to replace the Schlage 32-60-8-4 4-inch saws that I had in the past. I have had several of these saws for years and have used them with great success. I had to replace one with a Schlage saw because I had a problem with the wire holding it in place. I ended up returning the saw to the manufacturer for replacement. The new saws are much better and the wire holding them in place is much more secure.,5,These clamps worked extremely well and have kept the tools in good working order for a very long time I bought this to replace the Schlage 326084 4inch saws that I had in the past I have had several of these saws for years and have used them with great success I had to replace one with a Schlage saw because I had a problem with the wire holding it in place I ended up returning the saw to the manufacturer for replacement The new saws are much better and the wire holding them in place is much more secure,1

"Ate here a few months ago and I'm not quite sure why everyone else thinks the food is so great. The pumpkin and goat cheese croquets were probably the only dish I actually enjoyed. The razor clams were decent, but nothing to write home about. The egg with black truffles was extremely disappointing considering how much I love truffles. However, the worst part of the meal was a lobster dish that was barely edible. After the meal, my friends and I all regretted not sending that dish back when we had the chance. Perhaps I should have tried other dishes, but based on my last experience, I don't have any desire to go back.",2,Ate here a few months ago and Im not quite sure why everyone else thinks the food is so great The pumpkin and goat cheese croquets were probably the only dish I actually enjoyed The razor clams were decent but nothing to write home about The egg with black truffles was extremely disappointing considering how much I love truffles However the worst part of the meal was a lobster dish that was barely edible After the meal my friends and I all regretted not sending that dish back when we had the chance Perhaps I should have tried other dishes but based on my last experience I dont have any desire to go back,0

"Loved this little place. Had one of the best cous cous dishes I've had. Simple yet so good. Also had a walnut and smoked trout salad which also was really good, and a great portion. Their avocado toast seems to be a crowd favorite and looked good as well. It's pretty fun to watch the cooks in this tiny, tiny kitchen behind the bar. They're uber-efficient. It's pretty small so I'd call for big groups. But the prices are really reasonable for the food and portions. We doggy bagged our cous cous. Ate at the bar because it was packed so I don't know how the wait service was, but I'd say it will be fairly casual.

Uzaku - eel and seaweed - tender, flavorful, excellent. Seaweed salad - 4 types of seaweed, a little different than the usual, beautiful. Buta kakuni - pork belly - fantastic lick-your-lips fatty goodness. Grilled eggplant with three types of miso - absolutely delicious and surprisingly one of our favorite selections. Special of day - grilled sweet fish with sea salt - gorgeous but very little actual fish... hehe. Dessert: black sesame creme brulee with sesame ice cream - outstanding in flavor.

Simply the best pizza I have had in a long time. Wonderful flavors and well made cocktails. The staff is so friendly too. Basically if you like great pizza go there. The crust and olive oil they use is probably the best part of it.

"Althpugh the food may have been great, the service was horrible. The short lady with glasses was really rude when she talked to us. Me and two girls came and made a rsvp and we were told that they would call us when seats get available. The wait was 45 mins so we decided to go to a nearby store real quick. We came back 15 minutes before our estimated wait.when we got there they said they already called us and the lady rudely said with an attitude ""this is why I told you to stay outside and wait"".

"When you ask a girl where she like to go and her reply is sake, sake, sake! Sake Bar Hagi must come to mind. My first time to the establishment and it was a nice cozy. We tried a bottle of the house sake until we realize we needed to order another non house bottle with some kick to it. There were so many dishes I wanted to try but I will save the exotic dishes for myself next time around, since I was with a date, and certain tittles like pork belly, chicken gizzards and teriyaki squid didnt sound appealing to her. So we kept it simple like the dice steak, beef short ribs, deep fried tofu, etc...food that would not scare her off. The meal was a delight and somewhere between our 3 and 4 round of sake, she manage to order some cute pink colored drink (think was called sour grape) as a chaser. The bill was so reasonable I was able to have enough money to buy a cheap 2 dollar rose for her as we ended the night.

"Let me start by saying that I HAVE actually eaten here, unlike some other reviewers that feel the need to give up after the yes, quite challenging task of getting a reservation. (If you don't dine, don't review!) Getting a reservation is difficult but it IS possible and you don't have to KNOW someone to get a seat. You just have to be willing to put in a little time on a Monday morning. There are some common themes among other reviews. Some call the service ""robotic"", others would call it choreographed. The chef is quiet, shy and focused, he doesn't give you an elaborate story behind the creation of each dish, he tells you what you are eating and lets you know when you should enjoy it all in one bite. He is passive but friendly and will happily answer questions if you ask him at a slow moment. The atmosphere is quiet and intimate but shouldn't be confused with being pretentious. The chef and staff work diligently at their craft but at the end of the day seem to realize that their food is still in fact, food. This is not a typical restaurant, nor does it claim to be so the style of dining is also not typical. This is not the type of place that you bring your group of friends to celebrate a birthday or a promotion or to catch up on what they've been up to since you last saw them. This is a place to try perfectly paired ingredients of the highest quality. Its very simple. Watch. Taste. Reflect. Discuss. Repeat. The food was perfect. I mean, truly spot on. Decadent and simple, over the top and classic all at the same time. Truly a unique dining experience and one that forces you to appreciate each bite and then move on from it just as quickly. I walked in wondering if the experience would warrant the effort and expense enough to go back again. I walked out wondering how anyone could not go back again and again.",5,Let me start by saying that I HAVE actually eaten here unlike some other reviewers that feel the need to give up after the yes quite challenging task of getting a reservation If you dont dine dont review Getting a reservation is difficult but it IS possible and you dont have to KNOW someone to get a seat You just have to be willing to put in a little time on a Monday morning There are some common themes among other reviews Some call the service robotic others would call it choreographed The chef is quiet shy and focused he doesnt give you an elaborate story behind the creation of each dish he tells you what you are eating and lets you know when you should enjoy it all in one bite He is passive but friendly and will happily answer questions if you ask him at a slow moment The atmosphere is quiet and intimate but shouldnt be confused with being pretentious The chef and staff work diligently at their craft but at the end of the day seem to realize that their food is still in fact food This is not a typical restaurant nor does it claim to be so the style of dining is also not typical This is not the type of place that you bring your group of friends to celebrate a birthday or a promotion or to catch up on what theyve been up to since you last saw them This is a place to try perfectly paired ingredients of the highest quality Its very simple Watch Taste Reflect Discuss Repeat The food was perfect I mean truly spot on Decadent and simple over the top and classic all at the same time Truly a unique dining experience and one that forces you to appreciate each bite and then move on from it just as quickly I walked in wondering if the experience would warrant the effort and expense enough to go back again I walked out wondering how anyone could not go back again and again,0
"After reading numerous reviews on this place I decided to check it out, as it is within walking distance of my apartment. I came here on a Wednesday night and wow-it was crowded. Just as people described with cool memoribiila on the walls and a very ""old"" feeling inside. The food was good and cheap-very reasonable considering the area. I was here early-around 8 so I am not sure what it turns into later at night but this place seemed much more restaurant than bar to me. Almost the entire place is taken up by tables which is fine if you want to sit with friends but it is not really the typical bar scene I was expecting. All in all, I will definitely go back here with a small group of friends for the good food, nice and attentive wait staff and crayons on the tables.",4,After reading numerous reviews on this place I decided to check it out as it is within walking distance of my apartment I came here on a Wednesday night and wowit was crowded Just as people described with cool memoribiila on the walls and a very old feeling inside The food was good and cheapvery reasonable considering the area I was here earlyaround 8 so I am not sure what it turns into later at night but this place seemed much more restaurant than bar to me Almost the entire place is taken up by tables which is fine if you want to sit with friends but it is not really the typical bar scene I was expecting All in all I will definitely go back here with a small group of friends for the good food nice and attentive wait staff and crayons on the tables,0

"You know, I've lived in NYC for a decade now. I've spent a lot of time in the E.vill. I've (mis)spent many a night boozing around the village 'til the wee hours - often requiring ""second dinner"" on the way home. But I'd never been to PF until recently. Why? The line. I hate lines. They remind me of tourists and grade school and bathrooms at ballgames and other things I hate. So I never went. Which was a mistake, because this place is pretty cool. They serve fries. These aren't curly fries, steak fries, seasoned fries, cajun fries, sweet potato fries, shoestring fries, etc. These are fried potatoes. You can taste it, and it's good. They serve dipping sauces for the fries. They've got your basic ketchup, etc., but that's not why we're here. We're here for the Mango Chutney, the Parmesan Pepper, the Spicy Garlic. AND - as the nice fellow behind the counter was quick to offer, after I told him it was my first time - you can ask for free samples of the sauces. Now, if you're there at 3 am, and there are 50 people behind you in line, and you ask for 10 free samples, then you're likely to get something thrown at you (if there's someone like me behind you in line).

"Don't mistake this place for a bar. Apparently the owner has decided he doesn't want people to treat it as such. So I was a regular here for 1.5 years. I went there tonight with my partner and a friend from out of town. We sat at the corner of the bar, we ate dinner and moved on to drinks - chatting quietly (no raucous laughter or yelling - I hate that in other people and I avoid that myself). I just got cut off by the 21 year-old barman. This has been my favorite 'go-to' place for so long, but I guess no more. Apparently the owner has implemented a ""5 drink maximum"" after ""an incident."" I was certainly beyond that but, frankly, my tolerance is extremely high and I was barely beyond sober. I guess I'll find someplace else to tip 20% for drinks and be a good customer.",1,Dont mistake this place for a bar Apparently the owner has decided he doesnt want people to treat it as such So I was a regular here for 15 years I went there tonight with my partner and a friend from out of town We sat at the corner of the bar we ate dinner and moved on to drinks chatting quietly no raucous laughter or yelling I hate that in other people and I avoid that myself I just got cut off by the 21 yearold barman This has been my favorite goto place for so long but I guess no more Apparently the owner has implemented a 5 drink maximum after an incident I was certainly beyond that but frankly my tolerance is extremely high and I was barely beyond sober I guess Ill find someplace else to tip 20 for drinks and be a good customer,0

Google might not have it right either... there are some sigs and depending on the day you're going, just know where to go beforehand.

"I battled through hell and high water to get to this place today, literally. After my physical therapy treatment (due to ACL surgery) a buddy told me he had work this weekend so I had to cancel my flight and get penalized for it. Mother Nature also pulled out her strong winds and sideways rain to try to prevent me from getting my cha su rice from here. How dare she.... I proceeded to wait in line, and noticed an increase in price from $2.50 to $2.75!! I then see a sign by the register stating the $.25 increase started on 12/1, I check today's date and luck would have it, today's 12/1 CRAP!!!! I wanted to back out, $.25 more was just too much for this overgrown Chinese fella and also the fact that I woulda gotten $.50 back from my $3 which meant I could have used it to buy a today's copy of Chinese World Newspaper but now I look down at the change I got back....one, one single lonely quarter, in need of finding a mate so they can play together with their kind in a mooncake tin or plastic cup while I read my paper. Even though the temptation to leave was there I resisted, remembered what it took to get me here, and the fact that I was so deep into the line already. As it finally got up to my turn I ordered the special for $2.75, the chef stared at me looked down and then back up at my face and said I'm too tall for the small and I need to get the Large one. So for a dollar extra ($3.75) I got the large and as I walked out of Wah Fung, the sideways rain had stopped, the howling winds were a simple breeze, and I could start to hear the birds chirping congratulating me on my success (or were those just cars honking at each other while they were stuck in traffic?) Never the less with my cha su rice in one hand and a drink from Teado around the corner, all felt right in the world.

"Came in an hour before closing on a Saturday night with a friend and before we even walked through the door, a waft of deliciousness hit my nose. We were already full from dinner, and were at first hesitating to grab dessert, but the scent of crepe just called out to us. I'm so glad it did! The place is definitely small with limited seating (just a large table and a small counter), but the nutella and banana crepe I had here was on point! The crepe itself was delicately spongy, slightly crisp, and totally fresh. Add nutella and bananas and what more could you ask for? I also ordered a cafe au lait, which was also delicious (especially if you're drinking it with a delicious crepe!!) The crepes came out quickly and were offered on just a paper plate with a plastic fork. Don't be fooled by the simple cutlery because the crepe will win you over. It was just so delicate and had the perfect balance between crepe and filling and *insert drooling here*. I haven't had any of the other crepes that were offered, but I would, hands-down, come back here JUST for that crepe (and it takes me over half and hour to get here!)",5,Came in an hour before closing on a Saturday night with a friend and before we even walked through the door a waft of deliciousness hit my nose We were already full from dinner and were at first hesitating to grab dessert but the scent of crepe just called out to us Im so glad it did The place is definitely small with limited seating just a large table and a small counter but the nutella and banana crepe I had here was on point The crepe itself was delicately spongy slightly crisp and totally fresh Add nutella and bananas and what more could you ask for I also ordered a cafe au lait which was also delicious especially if youre drinking it with a delicious crepe The crepes came out quickly and were offered on just a paper plate with a plastic fork Dont be fooled by the simple cutlery because the crepe will win you over It was just so delicate and had the perfect balance between crepe and filling and insert drooling here I havent had any of the other crepes that were offered but I would handsdown come back here JUST for that crepe and it takes me over half and hour to get here,0

"My other culinary crush next to Chris Santos is Michael Psilakis. His take on the traditional Greek cuisines mama and grandma used to make gets me excited no matter where the venue. I had yet to try MP and decided to bring a friend for her belated birthday celebration. Our party of three was seated downstairs in the middle of the action. For an early Tuesday evening, the place was definitely bumpin' with all ages and types. Our server, Bart, was so professionally spot on. Just the right amount of suggestion and attentiveness. He handled a couple of snafus very well - the fact that they ran out of the spirits needed to make a delicious Angouri cocktail and the wrong (but so so right) meatballs being brought to the table. A couple of standouts from the variety of things we chose to share meze-style: The Cypriot sausage (great spice balance and perfectly grilled) the traditional meatballs we were brought by accident floating in their garlicy, Kalamata olive tomato stew, the barrel aged Feta with grilled veggie accompaniment and the dumplings with graviera and sausage (we were loving the sausage big time). When we had stuffed our faces to oblivion, I was secretly happy I chose the perfect apparatif of the Ploumari Ouzo drink, Limonada. There was no more room for desert, sadly, and Bart did not push us.

"I came here to NYC my first time, and kept hearing OVER AND OVER about how great ""chicken and rice"" was. My stomach and taste buds were constantly teased time and time again by my friends who would make late night stops here, whether it was on a chilled-out sober night, or a night when they just got sloshed. Me and my friend tried to drive here before heading out to Boston on my first trip to NYC, and we were greeted with a line that went ALL the way down the block--this was at least a 45 minute wait. I never got my chicken and rice. This time, I was gonna get it no matter what. My friend and I took the subway here at about 2am, and this was my last meal in NYC before I flew back to sunny CA 4 hours later. We waited in line for about 15 minutes on a Monday morning at 2am...this place HAS to be good if people are sacrificing their sleep for it. I ended up getting a lamb and chicken and rice plate. My friend topped it with the white sauce and just a little bit of red sauce--I asked him to put more because I have a high spice tolerance, but he said, ""Trust me, you don't want a lot of this..."" He was right, it was just the right amount to fulfill my spice cravings, and the white sauce was great to neutralize it when it got too spicy. The plate was filled with TONS of lamb and chicken, lettuce, orange rice, and about 3-4 pieces of flat bread. Mix it all together and enjoy a nice, warm, delicious meal. OH..can't forget the price. $6 for each plate! UNBELIEVABLE! I couldn't even finish more than half and I was starving beforehand too! They give you a TON of bang for your buck here.

"Made reservations for 9pm for 4 people on a Friday night and we were all on time. The hostess didn't seat us for another 45 minutes. The wait was excrutiating since we were all so hungry. Aside from the tortious wait, where they didn't even comp us a drink, the food was pretty decent and reasonably priced. We had a hamachi tartar, which seemed very fresh, a couple of the pastas which were really quite stellar, the octopus which was ok, the chicken and a couple of sides. The drinks were pretty good and we also had a couple of desserts.

"I must say, Grimaldi's has some pretty darn good brick oven pizza. I thought Grimaldi's would be a over hyped pizzeria because of it's name and fame but it's actually not. The ingredients were great. Their thin crust pies are very crunch and crispy. I really like the cheese they use and their not too heavy on the sauce. What I like most about Grimaldi's is that their pizza isn't full of grease and oil. I hate eating a pizza that is leaking orange oil. At Grimaldi's, I didn't get that at all. Every ingredient on their pizza is well balanced. There are 2 things I dislike about Grimaldi's. 1 - Their restroom was pretty nasty. Bunch of flies and mosquitoes everywhere and the floor was a hot mess too. 2 - When I was waiting to use the restroom, I stood right by where the guys prepare the pizzas. I saw a couple flies flying around touching the cheese and other ingredients. Verdict - Still very good brick oven pizza. I just wish they were cleaner. When I see things like that, I can't understand how some restaurants can get an A grade posted on their window from the health inspections.

"Eh. I'm sorry to say that this pizza legend didn't live up to my expectations. After living in NY for nearly a decade and enjoying some of this city's best pizza, I can't say that this joint belongs in the top 10 -- or even the top 20. Showing up ~30 minutes before opening time is key. I was nearly the first one there. No wait at all when the doors opened. But sadly, the pie left plenty to be desired. Although the dough is pretty tasty, the pie is cooked unevenly (yes, seemingly without love!), so parts are overly burnt, and others are white and doughy. Boo! We got half pepperoni, half plain. In retrospect, would have gotten all plain or at least another topping. The pepperoni was very poor quality. Seriously, if you want good pepperoni, go to Angelo's in midtown. Their pepperoni is the tastiest and leanest and spiciest I've had. Grimaldi's pepperoni tasted like it came from a supermarket package. The sauce was alright. The cheese was abundant, but not particularly good. All in all, a real disappointment. But the saving grace was the Brooklyn Bridge when we had washed our hands of the pie!",2,Eh Im sorry to say that this pizza legend didnt live up to my expectations After living in NY for nearly a decade and enjoying some of this citys best pizza I cant say that this joint belongs in the top 10 or even the top 20 Showing up 30 minutes before opening time is key I was nearly the first one there No wait at all when the doors opened But sadly the pie left plenty to be desired Although the dough is pretty tasty the pie is cooked unevenly yes seemingly without love so parts are overly burnt and others are white and doughy Boo We got half pepperoni half plain In retrospect would have gotten all plain or at least another topping The pepperoni was very poor quality Seriously if you want good pepperoni go to Angelos in midtown Their pepperoni is the tastiest and leanest and spiciest Ive had Grimaldis pepperoni tasted like it came from a supermarket package The sauce was alright The cheese was abundant but not particularly good All in all a real disappointment But the saving grace was the Brooklyn Bridge when we had washed our hands of the pie,0

It was very lively, lots of people and some nice music, but we didn't have to wait to be seated at all (we were 2).

I liked the spaghetti the best - kind of carbonara-esque. not as creamy but definitely cheesy and flavorful. The tajarin came in second. I loved chanterelles (not that strong of a flavor but good texture), corn and speck. Freshly made pasta so not as al dente as the spaghetti. Roasted quail was seasoned very very well.

"Completely disappointed in our 130$ meal. First upon arriving 10 minutes early for my reservation I was told that I had to wait in the entryway. I said I'd like to get a drink at the bar and was told the bar seating is reserved (there were 4 empty stools as well as empty tables) so I said I'd stand, to which she said no I can't do that but that I could go out in the pouring rain again to their ""sister restaurant"" for my drink. um ok? Really odd. But my date arrived we were sat and here is where things really got shitty. I have never felt so RUSHED in all my dining experiences. From the moment we sat our server was rushing us, throwing menus down and coming back literally 30 seconds later to take a drink order...um you just threw down an extensive cocktail menu and a menu with a bunch of wine on it, can we have maybe a minute to decide. Same thing with the food ordering. ABRUPT AND RUSHED. (BTW the place was not busy, the 6 top by us remained empty the entire time we were there, and when I went to the bathroom I noticed there were also 2 empty 2 tops which really irked me since we were being so rushed). Now to the food: we were told to order 5 dishes (it's shared plates) so that's what we did. Beet salad: underdressed if it were dressed at all, except for the few beets it was flavorless Salt and Pepper Shrimp: awful, my one shrimp wasn't even deveined. And I was expecting salt and pepper style and it was more sweet and sour. no crunch , the breading was all mushy. short rib sliders with sweet potato frys: this was the best thing we ordered which isn't saying much, tasty but nothing to write home about. Burrata: ridiculously small portion for the price, we weren't keen on the sauce either, again not much flavor. Gnocci: this maybe disappointed me the most, just very bland, obviously rolled out then cut - not how they should be prepared but I guess they must be rushed in the kitchen too. Donut: give me a break. 4 little crispy cream chunks that didn't even add up to a whole donut sprinkled with bacos and a spoonful of coffee ice cream. a joke. Now as I said we were rushed all the way through the meal. waiter rushing our ordering, bussers trying to take plates away we were obviously still eating from. And then the gnocci came out so late that we had even forgot we ordered it, if you are going to rush customers then at least have the food come out in good time.

It was a good ramen place. I think the wasabi shoyu ramen is a bit unconventional and strange. The wasabi smell/taste over powers the flavor and doesn't really go with anything. The karaka miso ramen was a bit heavy on the flavor as well. It was really buttery and thick which isn't really what Japas like. I got the akamaru modern and I liked it best bc I like that traditional simple flavor. The pork buns were delicious and soft but i could taste the mayo so they could ease up on that a bit. Overall a good ramen place for Americans but a bit pricey. I guess ur paying for the trendy NYC atmosphere which was nice.

"*BRUNCH REVIEW* A lot of people enjoy going out to dinner with friends for their birthday but I prefer brunch. It's less expensive, it's still good food, and in my old age I have come to really enjoy day drinking. It was my 25th this past weekend and since Joseph Leonard had been on my to-do list for what seems like an eternity, it was the perfect time to go. I was ready to be let down since my expectations were sky high, but hot damn did they deliver!!!!!! I arrived a little after 10:30am last Saturday and there was already a line out the door. When it was my turn to put my name on the list I explained to the hostess that I knew they don't do reservations, but wanted to know if my party of 4 could possibly be seated around noon. After all, I did show up 1.5 hours in advance. It's not like I attempted to pull this off over the phone from the comfort of my warm bed. I was a little afraid that she would bite my head off for even asking, but to my surprise she was extremely understanding and said she would do her best to seat us at that time. She couldn't guarantee a noon seating, but assured us that our party would take precedence over any other party of 4 at that time. Awesome! In the end, she stayed true to her word and we had an AMAZING brunch: The bloody: A+ for the original. I've tried many a bloody over the years and wholeheartedly dub Joseph Leonard's to be the best from a restaurant (nothing tops a homemade one). There is not the slightest hint of fish, it the furthest thing from bland, and it's just the right size served with a cute little beer chaser to finish it off. Love. The sprouts: yes yes yes. Get that sriracha! The egg sandwich: this is the perfect portion for such a buttery dish. The croissant is on the smaller size (compared to the ones from a bakery) and is served warmed (grilled?) with slices of manchego cheese inside. It is sooo sinful, but worth it. This menu option is the best bang for your buck since it comes with a side of the sprouts. The one thing none of us liked was their Michelada. VERY fishy. Immediately sent it back, ordered the original bloody (was charged for only one drink) and was much happier. As I mentioned it was my birthday, so at the end of our meal the waitress brought out a slice of THE most insane carrot cake any of us had ever, ever tasted. Seriously though... EVER. So moist and so fresh (there were shreds of actual carrot inside), lined with a cream cheese icing that is just to die for. It was huge, too- the 4 of us barely finished it. All in all, I found Joseph Leonard to be 100% worth the wait and not over-hyped at all. Would absolutely recommend for a special brunch date!",5,BRUNCH REVIEW A lot of people enjoy going out to dinner with friends for their birthday but I prefer brunch Its less expensive its still good food and in my old age I have come to really enjoy day drinking It was my 25th this past weekend and since Joseph Leonard had been on my todo list for what seems like an eternity it was the perfect time to go I was ready to be let down since my expectations were sky high but hot damn did they deliver I arrived a little after 1030am last Saturday and there was already a line out the door When it was my turn to put my name on the list I explained to the hostess that I knew they dont do reservations but wanted to know if my party of 4 could possibly be seated around noon After all I did show up 15 hours in advance Its not like I attempted to pull this off over the phone from the comfort of my warm bed I was a little afraid that she would bite my head off for even asking but to my surprise she was extremely understanding and said she would do her best to seat us at that time She couldnt guarantee a noon seating but assured us that our party would take precedence over any other party of 4 at that time Awesome In the end she stayed true to her word and we had an AMAZING brunch The bloody A for the original Ive tried many a bloody over the years and wholeheartedly dub Joseph Leonards to be the best from a restaurant nothing tops a homemade one There is not the slightest hint of fish it the furthest thing from bland and its just the right size served with a cute little beer chaser to finish it off Love The sprouts yes yes yes Get that sriracha The egg sandwich this is the perfect portion for such a buttery dish The croissant is on the smaller size compared to the ones from a bakery and is served warmed grilled with slices of manchego cheese inside It is sooo sinful but worth it This menu option is the best bang for your buck since it comes with a side of the sprouts The one thing none of us liked was their Michelada VERY fishy Immediately sent it back ordered the original bloody was charged for only one drink and was much happier As I mentioned it was my birthday so at the end of our meal the waitress brought out a slice of THE most insane carrot cake any of us had ever ever tasted Seriously though EVER So moist and so fresh there were shreds of actual carrot inside lined with a cream cheese icing that is just to die for It was huge too the 4 of us barely finished it All in all I found Joseph Leonard to be 100 worth the wait and not overhyped at all Would absolutely recommend for a special brunch date,0

"This book was like a breath of fresh air after decades of being immersed in the increasingly bizarre Niagara of conspiracy theories about the JFK assassination. Posner did what no one thought possible, he drained a swamp. Sticking to meticulous verifiable fact and going back to first sources Posner asserts that the truth was there all along. His reading style is easy, moving along and building up the facts bit by bit. What Posner shows is that these theories often collapse under the weight of their own Byzantine thinking. I still reread it occasionally just to enjoy a careful mind making a logical case out of a morass of nonsense.",5,This book was like a breath of fresh air after decades of being immersed in the increasingly bizarre Niagara of conspiracy theories about the JFK assassination Posner did what no one thought possible he drained a swamp Sticking to meticulous verifiable fact and going back to first sources Posner asserts that the truth was there all along His reading style is easy moving along and building up the facts bit by bit What Posner shows is that these theories often collapse under the weight of their own Byzantine thinking I still reread it occasionally just to enjoy a careful mind making a logical case out of a morass of nonsense,0

"Pluses: it's a beautiful place. High ceilings, walls and ceiling lovingly decorated with imports from Ireland. It's a majestic feeling inside. You'll want to go in just to have a look around. You should. You could spend days just examining the old photos of someone's Irish family. And the staff: from the friendly, always on-the-spot-filled-with-personality waitresses, to the as-friendly busboys who are as willing to help you with a photo as fill your water glass, you'll feel like you're going to miss them when you leave. You probably will. There's also a nice beer selection with quite a few tap and bottle beers. Slightly pricey, but normal for mid-town. The only minus: The volume level-- at least until 11:30. It's WAY too loud. The room accoustics already echo voices, but the generic music, played at jet-engine volume, make it so you have to scream to the person sitting next to you. It's tiring, and a fault far too common in NY. Still, it's the only fault... so GO! If the music bothers you, the volume seems to go down late at night. Visit after midnight.

"We all know Williamsburg sucks but occasionally when you feel like torturing yourself it's worth trying to wrangle a ride on one of the shitty lines that go out there (such as the G, which is the retarded mule version of a unicorn, in that it combines the rarity of a rainbow-colored unicorn with the speed of a three-legged, thoroughly inbred mule) and feel superior to mustachioed assholes while eating delicious things. Marlow & Sons chooses especially to be way the fuck out in nowhere, located where people have either never heard of the subway or are just too good for it I guess. But I've gone out there twice now and I can't say I've ever regretted the journey. I may be crabby as hell when I get there, but you know what, delicious, delicious food has a way of soothing the impotent 5'8"" rage within me. Marlow & Sons doesn't really have a gimmick (I guess other than the aforementioned being located way the fuck out in nowhere), which goes a long way toward making me not hate it. I suppose the closest thing it has is its constantly rotating menu, but I mean, as long as the famed brick chicken is a mainstay, there's no way you can complain. Other than that its only schtick is being ridiculously good. If it were an '80s wrestler, its peers would be busy pretending to be plumbers or dentists or repo men (who all have second jobs as wrestlers for some reason), while Marlow & Sons gets to be the Hogan or Flair type whose only deal is that he gets to be way more awesome than everyone else all the time forever. I hope it's not too obvious that the only reason I'm writing this is to work in old wrestling references, which is basically the only reason I do anything. Anyway onto the food. I don't really ""get"" oysters because to me they taste pretty okay for what amount to giant sea-boogers served on a jagged nature-spoon but that's about it. Marlow & Sons has a reputation for top-tier oysters I believe, but yeah, sorry, still not quite getting it. To me oysters will always be the food version of when white friends point out what have to be the most aesthetically absurd Asian chicks I've ever seen and immediately produce at least two sexual juices in response. Moving on to other things I don't like, my girlfriend ordered the chicken liver pate and immediately swooned over it; I declined because liver pate of course tastes like creamed dick. Speaking of, I also got the corn puree soup, which in my eyes was the only real ""miss"" of the evening that couldn't be chalked up to undue personal bias. It was fine, I mean, but I guess you can only gussy up corn soup so much. For the main event I got a brisket sandwich, which features delightful melt-in-your-mouth beef and a forest of cilantro on a bunly bun, and comes with crisp, excellently greasy spicy homemade potato chips. I was quite satisfied with my choice, but the unquestionable star of the show is the brick chicken. I'm sure there's 200 reviews below mine raving about it so I won't go on too long, but man. First of all, it's a huge portion, and comes with polenta, which makes everything better except maybe a deathly allergic reaction to polenta. Size and polenta alone, frankly, would be enough, but no, they had to go and make this a goddamn gift to taste buds, wrapped in a crispy skin of perfectly salty deliciousness. My only real complaint is that I wish with all the fiber of my being that they'd go ahead and hilariously serve it with a giant brick on top. Not only could I then suck on what has to be a pretty tasty, chickeny brick by now (who doesn't like a refreshing after-dinner brick?), but then I could also use it to brain the shit out of the mid-20s vest-wearing hipster seated next to us, who of course spent the whole meal audibly informing his fat girlfriend's parents about how great he is at acting in plays. Oh, kid. I wish I could tag you (and not just with the brick) before releasing you back into the wild, so I could be there and watch the day your dreams die. I mean, as good as the brick chicken is, nothing will ever, EEEEEEEverrrr, taste as fantastic as that.",4,We all know Williamsburg sucks but occasionally when you feel like torturing yourself its worth trying to wrangle a ride on one of the shitty lines that go out there such as the G which is the retarded mule version of a unicorn in that it combines the rarity of a rainbowcolored unicorn with the speed of a threelegged thoroughly inbred mule and feel superior to mustachioed assholes while eating delicious things Marlow Sons chooses especially to be way the fuck out in nowhere located where people have either never heard of the subway or are just too good for it I guess But Ive gone out there twice now and I cant say Ive ever regretted the journey I may be crabby as hell when I get there but you know what delicious delicious food has a way of soothing the impotent 58 rage within me Marlow Sons doesnt really have a gimmick I guess other than the aforementioned being located way the fuck out in nowhere which goes a long way toward making me not hate it I suppose the closest thing it has is its constantly rotating menu but I mean as long as the famed brick chicken is a mainstay theres no way you can complain Other than that its only schtick is being ridiculously good If it were an 80s wrestler its peers would be busy pretending to be plumbers or dentists or repo men who all have second jobs as wrestlers for some reason while Marlow Sons gets to be the Hogan or Flair type whose only deal is that he gets to be way more awesome than everyone else all the time forever I hope its not too obvious that the only reason Im writing this is to work in old wrestling references which is basically the only reason I do anything Anyway onto the food I dont really get oysters because to me they taste pretty okay for what amount to giant seaboogers served on a jagged naturespoon but thats about it Marlow Sons has a reputation for toptier oysters I believe but yeah sorry still not quite getting it To me oysters will always be the food version of when white friends point out what have to be the most aesthetically absurd Asian chicks Ive ever seen and immediately produce at least two sexual juices in response Moving on to other things I dont like my girlfriend ordered the chicken liver pate and immediately swooned over it I declined because liver pate of course tastes like creamed dick Speaking of I also got the corn puree soup which in my eyes was the only real miss of the evening that couldnt be chalked up to undue personal bias It was fine I mean but I guess you can only gussy up corn soup so much For the main event I got a brisket sandwich which features delightful meltinyourmouth beef and a forest of cilantro on a bunly bun and comes with crisp excellently greasy spicy homemade potato chips I was quite satisfied with my choice but the unquestionable star of the show is the brick chicken Im sure theres 200 reviews below mine raving about it so I wont go on too long but man First of all its a huge portion and comes with polenta which makes everything better except maybe a deathly allergic reaction to polenta Size and polenta alone frankly would be enough but no they had to go and make this a goddamn gift to taste buds wrapped in a crispy skin of perfectly salty deliciousness My only real complaint is that I wish with all the fiber of my being that theyd go ahead and hilariously serve it with a giant brick on top Not only could I then suck on what has to be a pretty tasty chickeny brick by now who doesnt like a refreshing afterdinner brick but then I could also use it to brain the shit out of the mid20s vestwearing hipster seated next to us who of course spent the whole meal audibly informing his fat girlfriends parents about how great he is at acting in plays Oh kid I wish I could tag you and not just with the brick before releasing you back into the wild so I could be there and watch the day your dreams die I mean as good as the brick chicken is nothing will ever EEEEEEEverrrr taste as fantastic as that,0

"Seriously can't go wrong with a name like Bubby's. I came here with a friend and had a very pleasant brunch. The wait was decent and although it was a last minute ""cash only"" and a little pricey, they certainly know how to give you a run for your money. And in ""times like these"" (which is quickly becoming the cliche phrase of the year fyi) that's certainly something to be grateful for. My Turkey BLT was bigger than my head and came loaded with the world's juiciest (but not greasy) and thickest applewood smoked bacon, tomato, lettuce and a mammoth load of lean turkey- All nestled between two generous slices of crusty, freshly baked bread.

My cousins and I decided to come to Smorgasburg to try out some foods. I've been to Bolivian Llama Party two years in a roll and they have never disappointed! We tried the chicken and beef saltena and each were full of flavors. I highly recommend tasting their Mango Maracuya and Maracuya-lemonade soda! Would love to come back again for the third time next year! Ramen Burger vs Bolivian - Bolivian all the way!

"We both ordered the Candied beefy burnt ends, which was not candied or crisp as the title suggests (see my photo's), the ends were the fatty portion / bottom of the meat. What happened to the candied beefy burnt ends that they advertise? You can clearIy see from my order that, that isn't what we got. Ordered the Brisket Philly cheese sandwich which was bland but came with coleslaw and a few pickles, nothing special. My friend ordered the Butcher Bar cheese burger with bacon (this is extra) . The Corn Bread is a no go, its dry and crumbly don't waste your money people. We weren't offered the apple crumb cake of which I'm told is complimentary, wonder why? see my photos.",1,We both ordered the Candied beefy burnt ends which was not candied or crisp as the title suggests see my photos the ends were the fatty portion bottom of the meat What happened to the candied beefy burnt ends that they advertise You can clearIy see from my order that that isnt what we got Ordered the Brisket Philly cheese sandwich which was bland but came with coleslaw and a few pickles nothing special My friend ordered the Butcher Bar cheese burger with bacon this is extra The Corn Bread is a no go its dry and crumbly dont waste your money people We werent offered the apple crumb cake of which Im told is complimentary wonder why see my photos,0

"I love pancakes, but I typically prefer them plain with butter and syrup. However, I found myself nearly drooling over Clinton's blueberry pancakes some time last year as I watched Throwdown. And even though they lost to Bobby, I knew I had to give them a shot. So what did I think when I finally tried them? Well, let's just say I still love my plain buttermilk pancakes... or blueberry pancakes if they're coming from Clinton's. Holy cow, these were some of the best pancakes I've ever had. They were incredibly fluffy and moist, the blueberries provided that extra burst of flavors and the butter maple syrup was phenomenal. Some might complain that the pancakes are too rich and sweet, and though I wouldn't completely disagree, I don't remember being bothered by it while I was wolfing them down. I just wish these breakfast joints offered a complete breakfast combo. You know: pancakes, eggs, hash browns and sausage/bacon. It's an extra $4 for a side of hash browns that's no different than any other I've had and $4 for each of the aforementioned items. Throw in a glass of orange juice and you're at a $30 bill for breakfast. I also tried a bite of my friend's Monte Cristo and I have to say I've had MCs that were far better. I would recommend just coming for the blueberry pancakes. 5 stars for the pancakes and uh... not so many stars for the negatives I've mentioned. I'll be nice and give them four overall. BTW, we got there a little before they opened, so we didn't have to wait long; something to consider when you go.",4,I love pancakes but I typically prefer them plain with butter and syrup However I found myself nearly drooling over Clintons blueberry pancakes some time last year as I watched Throwdown And even though they lost to Bobby I knew I had to give them a shot So what did I think when I finally tried them Well lets just say I still love my plain buttermilk pancakes or blueberry pancakes if theyre coming from Clintons Holy cow these were some of the best pancakes Ive ever had They were incredibly fluffy and moist the blueberries provided that extra burst of flavors and the butter maple syrup was phenomenal Some might complain that the pancakes are too rich and sweet and though I wouldnt completely disagree I dont remember being bothered by it while I was wolfing them down I just wish these breakfast joints offered a complete breakfast combo You know pancakes eggs hash browns and sausagebacon Its an extra 4 for a side of hash browns thats no different than any other Ive had and 4 for each of the aforementioned items Throw in a glass of orange juice and youre at a 30 bill for breakfast I also tried a bite of my friends Monte Cristo and I have to say Ive had MCs that were far better I would recommend just coming for the blueberry pancakes 5 stars for the pancakes and uh not so many stars for the negatives Ive mentioned Ill be nice and give them four overall BTW we got there a little before they opened so we didnt have to wait long something to consider when you go,0
"I've been contemplating what rating to give Ippudo for awhile. 4 stars it is, as yelp only has integer stars. In order to eat a $13 bowl of original Shiromaru ramen, we waited 2-3 hours in line. I arrived early after my wine class and put my name on ""The List"". 2 hours the hostess told me. 2 hours. for ramen. This better be the best ramen of my life, I thought to myself. I waited. We waited..and we weren't the only ones. Unlucky for us, those 2 plus hours was broken up in teasingly short 30 minute long increments. Only 30 minutes left.. we'll have a table ready after that she said. 30 minutes later... yes, only 45 minute wait left! wait... what? We finally make it in. Between Shiromaru, Akamaru, Miso Ramen, and Ramen salad, I choose the first ($13). I contemplate whether I should have ordered the extra noodles for an additional $2.95. It's already the most expensive ramen of my life, what's another 3 Shin Ramens.. I mean 3 bucks? It comes in a milky rich broth with the pale yellow noodles swimming beneath. Two pieces of pork lie atop accompanying the striped green scallions. Mmmm, the aroma. I dig in. First the broth. I drink and I slurp. Warmth and soothing richness coat my tongue in a comforting caress. A happy sigh escapes. The yellow curvy ramen noodles begin peaking out of the broth. A ha! Thin yet chewy. It is gone too soon. Hm, I should have left it alone in its brothy home to let it multiple a little longer. Oh, it doesn't work that way. I see. Well let's make a night of it. Sake! (at $65 dollars a bottle) Really smooth. We order two. Yipes! Matcha Brulee (Green tea brulee and vanilla ice cream with fruit and candied fruit slivers) Wow. Not over powering in its green tea-ness and yet, not overly sweet. Please sir, can I have some more? Ah.. a good meal. Worth a 2 hour plus long wait? Hard to say. I did it and still gave it 4 stars. I guess that speaks for itself. Would I do that again? Probably not. Maybe for a less busy lunch. They don't take reservations.

"I have never been disappointed in this location. Located inside of the Park Central Hotel building with a street front entrance, I walk past Starbucks and into Tisserie whenever I am in the mood for an empanada and a cup of coffee. If you haven't had Tisserie pastries before, they are worth a try. Many upscale hotels and restaurant venues use their product so you may have tried it and not realized it. They are known for French pastries with a Latin flair. The spinach & mushroom empanada hits the spot for a little snack. The quiche is another favorite. It comes with a small dressed salad and has a flaky crust that is never rubbery. They have a great line of pastries and sweets including a tasty guava chausson. Their coffee is consistent - strong without being bitter. They brand their own stick shaped sugar, Splenda and Sugar in the Raw and always keep the condiment area clean and well stocked including soy milk. If you take your order to go, the handled bag is just the perfect size. At this particular location you can take advantage of available wifi from the local area but they don't have their own so it isn't a particularly strong signal. It is frequented by a good number of tourists. They have a few seats by the window out to 7th Avenue which is always good for some people watching. They also have one of the best well kept single bathrooms in the back.",3,I have never been disappointed in this location Located inside of the Park Central Hotel building with a street front entrance I walk past Starbucks and into Tisserie whenever I am in the mood for an empanada and a cup of coffee If you havent had Tisserie pastries before they are worth a try Many upscale hotels and restaurant venues use their product so you may have tried it and not realized it They are known for French pastries with a Latin flair The spinach mushroom empanada hits the spot for a little snack The quiche is another favorite It comes with a small dressed salad and has a flaky crust that is never rubbery They have a great line of pastries and sweets including a tasty guava chausson Their coffee is consistent strong without being bitter They brand their own stick shaped sugar Splenda and Sugar in the Raw and always keep the condiment area clean and well stocked including soy milk If you take your order to go the handled bag is just the perfect size At this particular location you can take advantage of available wifi from the local area but they dont have their own so it isnt a particularly strong signal It is frequented by a good number of tourists They have a few seats by the window out to 7th Avenue which is always good for some people watching They also have one of the best well kept single bathrooms in the back,0
"Excellent place, so glad to live just a few blocks away. I admit that I was skeptical, from the outside this place looks like any other run-of-the-mill bodega. Inside, its different. The deli counter is covered with hand written signs detailing the many interesting gourmet sandwiches they make. I picked the Pho 1, which really did remind me of Pho, and was a great mix of spicy and sweet. Service was friendly, quick, and it only cost me $7 for the delicious and filling sandwich. One hint as well is that the Vazac's Horseshoe bar is just down the block. They have cheap beer and allow outside food, so it is a great spot to catch a game w/ a delicious sandwich.

"Came here last night with a party of 8. The all female waitstaff were very sweet and accommodating. This is apparently a BYOB spot, which many of the diners were taking advantage of. The noodle soups were delicious! I loved how they came in the ""small"" and ""large"" bowl sizes - small was perfect for most of the girls at the table. Hubby got one of the clay pot rice dishes (with pork and salty fish), which took the longest to come out, but was worth it for all the crispy edged rice on the bottom. The soup dumplings were also great! only 6 to an order instead of 8, but I also felt like they were a little larger than other places. The pork ones were better than the crab. I also loved the scallion pancakes, which were a little smaller than other places, but very, very crisp. To end the meal we all shared a honeydew infinity creamy ice. (""Shaved snow""). I'd never had shaved snow in the honeydew flavor before and it was amazing. They topped it with lychee ""bursting boba"" and 3Q jelly. SUPER good! Perfect way to wrap up our meal.",5,Came here last night with a party of 8 The all female waitstaff were very sweet and accommodating This is apparently a BYOB spot which many of the diners were taking advantage of The noodle soups were delicious I loved how they came in the small and large bowl sizes small was perfect for most of the girls at the table Hubby got one of the clay pot rice dishes with pork and salty fish which took the longest to come out but was worth it for all the crispy edged rice on the bottom The soup dumplings were also great only 6 to an order instead of 8 but I also felt like they were a little larger than other places The pork ones were better than the crab I also loved the scallion pancakes which were a little smaller than other places but very very crisp To end the meal we all shared a honeydew infinity creamy ice Shaved snow Id never had shaved snow in the honeydew flavor before and it was amazing They topped it with lychee bursting boba and 3Q jelly SUPER good Perfect way to wrap up our meal,0
"Delicious and amazing. Very small and intimate space with an open kitchen where you watch the chefs prepare the food you are going to be served. Their pickling liquid was used multiple times to pickle different items throughout the dinner and was amazing - especially noticeable when eating the ""quail egg"" (actually spherified aioli). Highlight for me was the cured swordfish belly which was one of the most amazing things I've ever tasted. I also loved the bread that was basted in pork fat - so amazing - I know I am going to dream about this piece of bread. I think the one miss was that the restaurant tries a bit too hard to make things appear as something they are not; It worked most of the time, but sometimes the food was very very interesting but tasted just okay as with the ""lichen"" cracker and the churro which was actually dried salsify. It was a unique, delicious and great experience overall which I wouldn't miss out on.",5,Delicious and amazing Very small and intimate space with an open kitchen where you watch the chefs prepare the food you are going to be served Their pickling liquid was used multiple times to pickle different items throughout the dinner and was amazing especially noticeable when eating the quail egg actually spherified aioli Highlight for me was the cured swordfish belly which was one of the most amazing things Ive ever tasted I also loved the bread that was basted in pork fat so amazing I know I am going to dream about this piece of bread I think the one miss was that the restaurant tries a bit too hard to make things appear as something they are not It worked most of the time but sometimes the food was very very interesting but tasted just okay as with the lichen cracker and the churro which was actually dried salsify It was a unique delicious and great experience overall which I wouldnt miss out on,0
"Not to be repetitive, but the decor in this place really does go a long way in making me heart it all the more: it has all the ambiance of an upscale eatery, with a much more reasonable price-tag. I'm not usually one for salads as an appetizer, but I have to say, my fellow Yelpers have a pt: the spicy tuna salad is on point. I honestly couldn't have imagined that many complex flavors in a salad, prior to tasting Room Service's. Roommate had the green dumplings, which were pretty dense. We also had the pumpkin curry--delish--and the spicy basil fried rice--solid but as impressive. Oh and their dozen+ varieties of mojitos are a must; coconut's a stand-out. Minus a star for servers who, though friendly, were decidedly distracted. Granted it was 9 on a Thurs. night, and the place was packed, so at least they weren't just being lazy.",4,Not to be repetitive but the decor in this place really does go a long way in making me heart it all the more it has all the ambiance of an upscale eatery with a much more reasonable pricetag Im not usually one for salads as an appetizer but I have to say my fellow Yelpers have a pt the spicy tuna salad is on point I honestly couldnt have imagined that many complex flavors in a salad prior to tasting Room Services Roommate had the green dumplings which were pretty dense We also had the pumpkin currydelishand the spicy basil fried ricesolid but as impressive Oh and their dozen varieties of mojitos are a must coconuts a standout Minus a star for servers who though friendly were decidedly distracted Granted it was 9 on a Thurs night and the place was packed so at least they werent just being lazy,0
"I'd describe the food as the bastard child of Prune and Blue Smoke. Good, wholesome, comforting dishes with a little flair. The bacon added an interesting note to the brittle. The chips and dip was a great bar snake. The one eyed caesar and the short rib app were as good as one can expect. Actually, I'd prefer my eggs a little runnier on the one eye but that's a minor complaint. Fried chicken, shrimp and grits, and the cauliflower gratin were also very good. I'd say the cauliflower was a little one dimensional. Maybe some sort of crunch or flavor would have made it a little more unique. The desserts were damn good. The figgy pudding was like a bastardized yummy creme brulee in that in looked like a creme brulee, but didn't taste like a creme brulee. Definitely try it if you go. If I lived in the EV, I could see this place as one of my go to drink/hang out/eat places.",4,Id describe the food as the bastard child of Prune and Blue Smoke Good wholesome comforting dishes with a little flair The bacon added an interesting note to the brittle The chips and dip was a great bar snake The one eyed caesar and the short rib app were as good as one can expect Actually Id prefer my eggs a little runnier on the one eye but thats a minor complaint Fried chicken shrimp and grits and the cauliflower gratin were also very good Id say the cauliflower was a little one dimensional Maybe some sort of crunch or flavor would have made it a little more unique The desserts were damn good The figgy pudding was like a bastardized yummy creme brulee in that in looked like a creme brulee but didnt taste like a creme brulee Definitely try it if you go If I lived in the EV I could see this place as one of my go to drinkhang outeat places,0

First off this place is in an area that is rarely frequented by people so it is nice to have a chance of scenery. It it's a French inspired restaurant and the design is nice. The staff tries to be nice but one off the French waitresses had a bit off an attitude. A bit snobbish in fact. The wine selection is great but the food is a little off. We order several different plates to share but was not blown away. If you have nice wine your food should compliment it. Or the other way around. The escargot was nice but a pasta plate that we ordered looked nice but was flavorless and bland. If it is at a high price for a small portion I expect to be blown away. So by for a glass of wine the go to the next place tio eat.,2,First off this place is in an area that is rarely frequented by people so it is nice to have a chance of scenery It its a French inspired restaurant and the design is nice The staff tries to be nice but one off the French waitresses had a bit off an attitude A bit snobbish in fact The wine selection is great but the food is a little off We order several different plates to share but was not blown away If you have nice wine your food should compliment it Or the other way around The escargot was nice but a pasta plate that we ordered looked nice but was flavorless and bland If it is at a high price for a small portion I expect to be blown away So by for a glass of wine the go to the next place tio eat,1

"So this is my official 3 star stamp, I been here twice, once for dinner in June '12 and Christmas eve '14 for their Chinese Xmas and I was not blown away by either meal. I am in the minority opinion amongst Yelpers since everyone seems to go gaga over this unkosher restaurant that serves American small plates but simply put, I was disappointed, twice non the less. The meal definitely had some high points, but after the first set of rounds, which were respectable, it quickly went down hill after the 5th to 10th plates. If the first round stayed consistent throughout the meal, a 4 star review would apply, but this was not the case. For the food, I will list the order in which the food came out. Also, the service does earn a point of mention since they were so friendly and welcoming and I feel they went above and beyond for my friend who has a soy allergy. They were able to accommodate her and accommodate her well. The food: Strawberry-Cinnamon glazed Berkshire baby back ribs- Reg menu. This is kind of their go to dish. I ordered this on both visits and truth be told, they were just regular tender ribs, and I also didn't get a strawberry note at all. It also bothered me that the ribs weren't hot but lukewarm. It's a pretty dish but I don't see the hype. Sweet & Sour pork belly, Korean chile paste, quince, pineapple, haricots- Xmas menu. It was a nice dish, it was a sizable dish and the pork belly was tender, but I felt it should have been a little more tender and should have had a tad bit more fat. It didn't have the unctuousness I expect from pork belly. I also wish there was some type of exterior crust on the pork belly. The flavors were good but could have been tweaked. Lettuce, mac apples, grapes, bacon, blue cheese, sunflower, pomegranate- Reg menu. This dish stood throughout the night as my favorite dish. It seems absurd for me to enjoy salad so much, but it was a testament to how great the salad was. The salad was so wonderfully sweet and savory. The greens were dressed properly, the apples offered a nice crunch, the grapes and pomegranate added a wonderful sweetness and there was a amazing underlying blue cheese note throughout the salad that was fantastico. And crispy bacon needs no mention lol Stir-fried Mongolian lamb tongue, cumin,Szechuan peppercorns- Xmas menu. The lamb tongue was so insanely tender, no teeth required, but the flavor was just OK for me. I didn't think this dish was that memorable and there was no heat what so ever from the peppercorn. I thought the sauce was too overpowering and gloppy and the tongue taste was lost, it seemed like it was only there for texture. Spicy bigeye tuna tartare, tempura Japanese, eggplant, kecap manis- Reg menu. This dish had no heat, the tuna had good flavor but the eggplant did not have a pleasant texture. The eggplant was too soft and not really crunchy, it was also greasy to boot. The tuna by itself was nice, the bottom, not so much. Joe's chopped chicken livers, balsamic-bacon toasts, rosemary & shallots- Reg Menu. I was super excited to try this dish, but sadly, it was one of my least favs. It really didn't resemble chopped liver at all, the flavors were so mild and the toast was a bad choice, the toast was too thick and the balsamic was too sweet, not a pairing that worked for me. Dayboat scallops, butternut squash risotto, huckleberry, pistachio, sage- Reg menu. The scallops were cooked well, super soft and tender, a tad under for me, but the risotto bothered me. I was expecting a little bite from the rice but it seemed more like pumpkin rice pudding than risotto The texture of risotto usually has some type of a chew to the rice, the rice in this dish was soft throughout. Spicy garlic roasted eggplant & crispy sweetbreads, arbol chillies- Xmas menu. This was essentially General Tso's chicken. The dish was too sweet for me, the heat was OK but the sweetbreads, which are normally creamy and milky, were completely lost when it was fried and submerged in the overpowering and overly sweet General Tso's sauce. The fact that it was sweetbreads didn't help at all, they could have easily used chicken and it wouldn't have changed the flavor at all. Crispy whole-fried flounder, curry-coconut sauce, Chinese sausage- Xmas menu. This dish bothered me a lot. First, the overpowering smell of the curry was too much. Second, the coconut was so unpleasantly flavored and way too sweet. Third, the fish was overcooked and dry, while being greasy. The fish wasn't really crunchy either, it was basically limp and it looked that way when it was put on the table. I knew when I saw it, I wasn't going to like it. Lastly, I did not like the Chinese sausage they used. It almost seemed like a fake Chinese sausage or Costco brand. Five-spice layer cake, yuzu, sesame, coconut- I thought this was a nice finish to the meal.

The cake was a tad dense though.",3,So this is my official 3 star stamp I been here twice once for dinner in June 12 and Christmas eve 14 for their Chinese Xmas and I was not blown away by either meal I am in the minority opinion amongst Yelpers since everyone seems to go gaga over this unkosher restaurant that serves American small plates but simply put I was disappointed twice non the less The meal definitely had some high points but after the first set of rounds which were respectable it quickly went down hill after the 5th to 10th plates If the first round stayed consistent throughout the meal a 4 star review would apply but this was not the case For the food I will list the order in which the food came out Also the service does earn a point of mention since they were so friendly and welcoming and I feel they went above and beyond for my friend who has a soy allergy They were able to accommodate her and accommodate her well The food StrawberryCinnamon glazed Berkshire baby back ribs Reg menu This is kind of their go to dish I ordered this on both visits and truth be told they were just regular tender ribs and I also didnt get a strawberry note at all It also bothered me that the ribs werent hot but lukewarm Its a pretty dish but I dont see the hype Sweet Sour pork belly Korean chile paste quince pineapple haricots Xmas menu It was a nice dish it was a sizable dish and the pork belly was tender but I felt it should have been a little more tender and should have had a tad bit more fat It didnt have the unctuousness I expect from pork belly I also wish there was some type of exterior crust on the pork belly The flavors were good but could have been tweaked Lettuce mac apples grapes bacon blue cheese sunflower pomegranate Reg menu This dish stood throughout the night as my favorite dish It seems absurd for me to enjoy salad so much but it was a testament to how great the salad was The salad was so wonderfully sweet and savory The greens were dressed properly the apples offered a nice crunch the grapes and pomegranate added a wonderful sweetness and there was a amazing underlying blue cheese note throughout the salad that was fantastico And crispy bacon needs no mention lol Stirfried Mongolian lamb tongue cuminSzechuan peppercorns Xmas menu The lamb tongue was so insanely tender no teeth required but the flavor was just OK for me I didnt think this dish was that memorable and there was no heat what so ever from the peppercorn I thought the sauce was too overpowering and gloppy and the tongue taste was lost it seemed like it was only there for texture Spicy bigeye tuna tartare tempura Japanese eggplant kecap manis Reg menu This dish had no heat the tuna had good flavor but the eggplant did not have a pleasant texture The eggplant was too soft and not really crunchy it was also greasy to boot The tuna by itself was nice the bottom not so much Joes chopped chicken livers balsamicbacon toasts rosemary shallots Reg Menu I was super excited to try this dish but sadly it was one of my least favs It really didnt resemble chopped liver at all the flavors were so mild and the toast was a bad choice the toast was too thick and the balsamic was too sweet not a pairing that worked for me Dayboat scallops butternut squash risotto huckleberry pistachio sage Reg menu The scallops were cooked well super soft and tender a tad under for me but the risotto bothered me I was expecting a little bite from the rice but it seemed more like pumpkin rice pudding than risotto The texture of risotto usually has some type of a chew to the rice the rice in this dish was soft throughout Spicy garlic roasted eggplant crispy sweetbreads arbol chillies Xmas menu This was essentially General Tsos chicken The dish was too sweet for me the heat was OK but the sweetbreads which are normally creamy and milky were completely lost when it was fried and submerged in the overpowering and overly sweet General Tsos sauce The fact that it was sweetbreads didnt help at all they could have easily used chicken and it wouldnt have changed the flavor at all Crispy wholefried flounder currycoconut sauce Chinese sausage Xmas menu This dish bothered me a lot First the overpowering smell of the curry was too much Second the coconut was so unpleasantly flavored and way too sweet Third the fish was overcooked and dry while being greasy The fish wasnt really crunchy either it was basically limp and it looked that way when it was put on the table I knew when I saw it I wasnt going to like it Lastly I did not like the Chinese sausage they used It almost seemed like a fake Chinese sausage or Costco brand Fivespice layer cake yuzu sesame coconut I thought this was a nice finish to the meal It was light and refreshing the coconut ice cream had nice flavor and the yuzu offered a nice refreshing tartness The cake was a tad dense though,0
"I love the Boil! Delicious food, friendly service and a chill crowd. Very West Coasty and a must for people who love their shellfish as much as I do. Be prepared to get your hands dirty though and don't make any plans for after since you will be sure to want to waddle home and wash all the fish off. We had the soft shell crab to start which was just okay, then we shared bags of the Lobster, Shrimp, Crawfish and Dungeness Crab. The shrimp was my absolute favorite (suck the head!) but everything was delicious in that buttery garlicky old bay sauce. The corn and potatoes were also super flavourful in that sauce and the only thing I wished was that there was more of it.

"Not a big fan of French food or flatbreads, however I was pleasantly surprised with what this place had to offer. Wide range of drinks from cappuccinos to bottomless mamosa specials makes this place an ideal spot for brunch.

The goat cheese and bacon was a great combination on their classic ""Traditionnelle"" flatbread. The desserts are a must have!

I placed an order on seamless today and told them to prepare the food strictly vegetarian without fish/meat/egg and they rejected my order saying that they always use fish/oyster sauce.

"This place proves that size isn't everything. The cafe is smaller than a NYC apartment (ohh yeah) and fits about 20 on a good day. The kitchen is just big enough for one person to move around in..and from the limited amount of space and tools that the cook has to work with, you would be surprised at the quality food they churn out. I have found my new #1 burger place in the country. Having lived on the West Coast, I constantly lust for In-n-Out. Last night, I began my affair with the Bronte burger. Sweet chili sauce, fresh greens and tomatoes, and cheese over a thick succulent juicy medium-rare burger patty, paired with a tasty side salad. I was full from the soup and pumpkin salad (also very good) before I got to my burger, but I still managed to scarf the whole thing down even though I was bursting. I just didn't want the taste to end.

"As a Canadian living in NY, there are a few things that makes me miss home and one of those things is the Poutine. When I first moved here back in college, I was shocked and saddened to find out that this savory treat is a rare find, even in a city that's known to have everything in excess. Pommes Frites fixed that for me, their take on the Poutine is authentic, hearty and delicious.

"Wow, it abosolutley pains me to write this review....but it's been a while since I have been here so maybe something has gone down hill. I was estatic to get NYE reservations for my out of town San Fran guests for the pre-fix dinner. Despite calling the restaraunt the day before to inform them of some of my dietarty restrictoins they still had trouble accomodating and the food that I could eat along with my guests was just average. When we arrived at the restaunt I infomed them I could not eat raw food, shell fish or game meat. They told me they could accomodate, then I also told the waitress. They told me they had other options prepared. We started with the oyster and caviar....unfortunately I could not eat the oyster and asked for a cooked option, and I got raw caviar. Couldn't eat that either. Then on to the kompachi, my guests loved it, however I got a seared piece of fish that is clearly not meant to be cooked. Then we got the Foie gras and I informed them I could not eat the game meat, and they brought me a salad. A salad as a swap for a Foie gras? come on....then the fish came, and it was cooked thank god, however it had a raw smell coming from it and it just smelled bad. I was shocked, i have never had a piece of fish from this place that stunk, I thought it was me but the rest of my guests agreed and one left half on her plate. Then on to the prime rib, I woudl rate this as average simply becauase the meat was so marbled with just pockets of fat nodules that most was un eatable, too bad because the sauce was excellent! We all then got the bannana with jameson icecream for desert which was divine. Overall our bill was 850$ ....400 in food rest on wine... I was just really upset to find that they kept giving me the low end crap as substitutes and then when I went over to the bar I saw pepople eating the chili lobster which is a great dish. I even offered to pay more for something else off the menue and I was not given the option. I am dissapointed because I was embarassed in fron of my guests for the fish and then feel like a really great place fell off our list....I am not sure if there is a new chef but I won;t be coming back for a while. - Fail by Marc Forgione this NYE",2,Wow it abosolutley pains me to write this reviewbut its been a while since I have been here so maybe something has gone down hill I was estatic to get NYE reservations for my out of town San Fran guests for the prefix dinner Despite calling the restaraunt the day before to inform them of some of my dietarty restrictoins they still had trouble accomodating and the food that I could eat along with my guests was just average When we arrived at the restaunt I infomed them I could not eat raw food shell fish or game meat They told me they could accomodate then I also told the waitress They told me they had other options prepared We started with the oyster and caviarunfortunately I could not eat the oyster and asked for a cooked option and I got raw caviar Couldnt eat that either Then on to the kompachi my guests loved it however I got a seared piece of fish that is clearly not meant to be cooked Then we got the Foie gras and I informed them I could not eat the game meat and they brought me a salad A salad as a swap for a Foie gras come onthen the fish came and it was cooked thank god however it had a raw smell coming from it and it just smelled bad I was shocked i have never had a piece of fish from this place that stunk I thought it was me but the rest of my guests agreed and one left half on her plate Then on to the prime rib I woudl rate this as average simply becauase the meat was so marbled with just pockets of fat nodules that most was un eatable too bad because the sauce was excellent We all then got the bannana with jameson icecream for desert which was divine Overall our bill was 850 400 in food rest on wine I was just really upset to find that they kept giving me the low end crap as substitutes and then when I went over to the bar I saw pepople eating the chili lobster which is a great dish I even offered to pay more for something else off the menue and I was not given the option I am dissapointed because I was embarassed in fron of my guests for the fish and then feel like a really great place fell off our listI am not sure if there is a new chef but I wont be coming back for a while Fail by Marc Forgione this NYE,0

"OMG Can you believe NYC finally has The Boiling Crab- err, The Boil?! The restaurant is on the smaller size, so if you want a guaranteed seat right away, come right when they open at 5. Especially if you have a large group. Right when you get seated they dress you up with a bib and gloves. My advice, skip those gloves. They're the cheap blue thick plastic ones which you do not want your tongue to come in contact with. I wish they would replace those with clear very thin plastic ones. The food is pretty incredible, the BOIL sauce is more on the garlic-y side. I always get the shrimp in the Boil sauce, which never disappoints. Cajun fries compliments the shrimp perfectly. You can ask for extra sauce and seasoning on anything. Staff is very attentive, although the bus boys are too eager to get your ass out. They magically appeared the second I was finished with my last bite and will take away the table cloth along with everything else on the table WITHOUT asking you if they can do so. They also stand right next to your table whilst staring at your table so that you feel uncomfortable and leave right away. Also, they don't have drink specials. Cocktails don't taste special enough to warrant the price tag.",4,OMG Can you believe NYC finally has The Boiling Crab err The Boil The restaurant is on the smaller size so if you want a guaranteed seat right away come right when they open at 5 Especially if you have a large group Right when you get seated they dress you up with a bib and gloves My advice skip those gloves Theyre the cheap blue thick plastic ones which you do not want your tongue to come in contact with I wish they would replace those with clear very thin plastic ones The food is pretty incredible the BOIL sauce is more on the garlicy side I always get the shrimp in the Boil sauce which never disappoints Cajun fries compliments the shrimp perfectly You can ask for extra sauce and seasoning on anything Staff is very attentive although the bus boys are too eager to get your ass out They magically appeared the second I was finished with my last bite and will take away the table cloth along with everything else on the table WITHOUT asking you if they can do so They also stand right next to your table whilst staring at your table so that you feel uncomfortable and leave right away Also they dont have drink specials Cocktails dont taste special enough to warrant the price tag,0

THE WORST. Our main courses were COLD. All four of them. We waited over an hour and some change for our food. The food wasn't really very good. Maybe it would have been if any of it was warm. At all.

"I've been coming here off and on every once in a while since college, and my experiences have varied greatly from visit to visit. Keep in mind, the food is great and the service is usually acceptable, although I had two really awful experiences here that were a far cry from ""once in a lifetime."" First and foremost, reservations are seriously hit or miss. If you reserve on a Friday or Saturday night, it doesn't seem to matter--we showed up thirty minutes prior to the reservation (just because we were early) and they didn't have a table ready for us for almost an hour after the reservation passed. We had a group of 12 for a friend's birthday, and had called the night before. To make matters worse, they sat us downstairs... in the corner of an actual *wedding reception*, complete with kids running around in suits. It sure was nice being able to participate in a toast to the bride and groom while we were trying to have a good time ourselves, not to mention the waiter basically forgot about us because we were the only non-reception table there. Secondly, I came here tonight--the night of this review--with my parents, who were in from out of town. We kind of made a last minute decision to go to Tonys--I had taken them there during the week a year or two ago--so we didn't have reservations, which is fine. We get there at 8, have a hour and a half wait time. The head waitress kept saying, ""Its 9:31 unless we can seat you earlier."" We even confirmed the name, because we thought there might have been confusion over the name we placed it under. 9:45 rolls around, and we're the ONLY ones waiting... so I go check with the waitress--our name had mysteriously disappeared. WHAT?? The only excuse we got was, ""Sorry, we can add you, but it'll be _at least_ another 20 minutes."" We stormed out of there and went to the Brooklyn Diner next door--the friendly, personable waiter there instantly made it a good choice. It just seems like this place is not well run. Expect to wait a long time for your food on a crowded night--minimum of an hour--and don't expect to have any conversations that don't involve yelling across your table. The food itself is actually quite good, but if you want more options without the hassle, head downtown to Little Italy.

"I've drunk beer with the tongue of angels I have quaffed an Ale Hop Devil It was warm in the night I was cold as a stone But I still haven't found what I'm looking for... With apologies to U2 (that song was my favorite track off of both ""Joshua Tree"" and ""Rattle and Hum""), I felt it appropriate to try to incorporate that U2 classic into my review, hence, the poetic license. I like Rattle N Hum. It's a smaller, noisier, livelier place than its crosstown big brother, Beer Authority and it has a much more laid back feel. The beer list is extensive, with frequent specials and rotating taps. The only bad thing is that you might go one week, have a great beer, and then the next time you go back, it's off the menu. Service when I've been there has been very good. Friendly bartenders and wait staff. I ate some nachos which were fine, but neither mind-blowing nor mouthwatering.

"For the most part, I'd like to turn over my time, legislature-style, to Chun L's review of Ovest Pizzoteca. yelp.com/biz/ovest-pizzo His recommendation made me look like a real ace in front of my visiting dad and his new wife. We started with a deliciously meaty, nonrubbery octopus salad with vinegary, thin fennel and pretty green and kalamata olives atop a bright purple radicchio bed. To help whet and appetize us further, we snagged the pear starter with herbed goat cheese, complex honey and a dainty little pile of arugula. Someone noncolorblind person in charge cares about aesthetics. Soon thereafter... the pizzas. ooohhhh boy. I'm a pizza eater for sure, but I don't have a fancy vocabulary about regions and supposedtobes. The crust was burny but not too crunchcrunch, the sauce was yummy and not yucky. Ovest: The ricotta was sweet and thick, and sparely dolloped atop the big salty salame slices. I didn't notice the promised garlic.

"This is my go-to for Italian near Boerum Hill. They deliver, which is a plus, but it's better to go in. Such a great atmosphere and perfect for dates. Like awesome for dates.

"I finally got a chance to see for myself after hearing so much praise for this place. Is it worth all the hype? Yes and no.... I've been here twice so far and had to wait about 45 minutes to an hour. I loOoOoved the appetizers. The Hirata Buns are really yummy, great flavor. I really liked the ramens but not worth all the hype. The service there was okay but it wasn't great due to the place being really busy.

"Boyfriend was looking at different places on yelp and came upon Hummus & Pita Co. We both love hummus and we decided to try this place out. I was reading some of the reviews and pictures and like everyone else that reviewed this place, it's just like Chipotle, except it's mediterranean food. If you know how to order from Chipotle, then you know how to order from Hummus & Pita. It is a good place to get a quick lunch, it's super filling and you can get a big meal for under 10 dollars. My boyfriend and I decided to order a plate each and share. They have a wide variety of drinks, from soda from the soda fountain, to bottle/can soda and bottled water. They also have fresh juices. My boyfriend ordered a gyro plate, and he chose the israeli salad, corn salad, chickpea salad as his 3 fill its. He also added pickles and lettuce as the free toppings. The plate also comes with a free side of hummus and pita. You have your choice of white or whole wheat pita. I ordered the falafel plate (came with 5 falafels) with Israeli salad, cous cous, and fried eggplants. I chose lettuce tomato and onions as my toppings and also got a side of tzatziki sauce. Again, hummus and pita comes with the plate order. We shared a small ordered of fries and had a bottle of root beer. RIght off the bat, the main dishes (the gyro and the falafel) was not hot. It has been left out for too long. I thought the gyro would be hot since it's just been spinning on the fire. It was luke warm. Same goes for the falafel. It was not crunchy, it was just warm. The salads were great though. All the veggies are fresh. The fried eggplant was overdone as it was a little bitter. The hummus was filling and smooth. The pita was soft and doughy, a great hummus scooper. The cous cous was a little chewy too my liking, the texture almost tasted like plastic. The fries were great, crispy on the outside, potatoey on the inside. Without the fries and the drinks added onto the bill, my plate came up to about 8 dollars and my boyfriend's plate came up to be about 10. The place is comfortable, there is outdoor seating by the front. You can also see the servers making the pita bread right by the ordering station. They also serve other things like quiche and baklava. I did not try it since I had to carry my belly out the door. It really is a great place to grab a quick and filling lunch.

"Alameda has potential, but its downright greedy. The artichoke is excellent, but I would eat them out of a jar at the supermarket and say the same thing. The burger is good, but its a shake shack sized single patty (too thin to cook medium-rare) and for 11 bucks with handful of fries, a bit of a ripoff. I considered buying a 2nd one, but decided against it. A sausage for 11 bucks is just abusive for bar food (compare to the 6 dollar one at black rabbit a couple blocks away), and my main gripe, if you're gonna serve me a 10 dollar drink in a 6 oz wine glass, it better not be bottom shelf overholt rye, (and if I choose to go with the cheap stuff, I should be rewarded with a big fat, boozy, indulgent cheap drink due to the lack of cost to you, not a dainty cocktail that is fairly expensive and gone in 3 sips). Inside is nice and has a good atmosphere, but my idea of a good time isn't staring at a nicely curated vintage stool. I'm just not gonna drop 70 bucks on a round of drinks, a shared app, and a sausage and cheeseburger, and leave hungry and sober. My issue wasn't with the quality or execution of anything, as everyone seems to be trying their best, just with portion size and price and my fear that new restaurants are geared toward treating greenpointers like they are dining in soho. I hope that they pull it together and become more of a bar for the people. Service was very good, but in a bar that small, its not even really necessary. Bottom line is that Alameda is too fancy for its own good and could benefit from a little more substance and a little less fluff.",3,Alameda has potential but its downright greedy The artichoke is excellent but I would eat them out of a jar at the supermarket and say the same thing The burger is good but its a shake shack sized single patty too thin to cook mediumrare and for 11 bucks with handful of fries a bit of a ripoff I considered buying a 2nd one but decided against it A sausage for 11 bucks is just abusive for bar food compare to the 6 dollar one at black rabbit a couple blocks away and my main gripe if youre gonna serve me a 10 dollar drink in a 6 oz wine glass it better not be bottom shelf overholt rye and if I choose to go with the cheap stuff I should be rewarded with a big fat boozy indulgent cheap drink due to the lack of cost to you not a dainty cocktail that is fairly expensive and gone in 3 sips Inside is nice and has a good atmosphere but my idea of a good time isnt staring at a nicely curated vintage stool Im just not gonna drop 70 bucks on a round of drinks a shared app and a sausage and cheeseburger and leave hungry and sober My issue wasnt with the quality or execution of anything as everyone seems to be trying their best just with portion size and price and my fear that new restaurants are geared toward treating greenpointers like they are dining in soho I hope that they pull it together and become more of a bar for the people Service was very good but in a bar that small its not even really necessary Bottom line is that Alameda is too fancy for its own good and could benefit from a little more substance and a little less fluff,0
"Monday night $28 three course prix fixe is worth way more than that in taste and portion. Cauliflower and leek soup was creamy and warm with brioche croutons and grilled cauliflower. Honey crisp apple and chicory was well dressed but a little small portion wise. We also ordered the chicken liver mousse that was served with grilled toast and grilled grapes which perfectly complimented each other. Sprinkle some salt that comes with to add flavor to the mousse. Hake was wonderfully cooked with delicious sauce. Buttermilk fried chicken was well seasoned and battered, slaw dressed well and went all together with waffle. Coffee pot de creme was good, but could of used more coffee flavor. Pecan pie sundae was also good but a little too sweet. Would return for brunch and regular dinner.",5,Monday night 28 three course prix fixe is worth way more than that in taste and portion Cauliflower and leek soup was creamy and warm with brioche croutons and grilled cauliflower Honey crisp apple and chicory was well dressed but a little small portion wise We also ordered the chicken liver mousse that was served with grilled toast and grilled grapes which perfectly complimented each other Sprinkle some salt that comes with to add flavor to the mousse Hake was wonderfully cooked with delicious sauce Buttermilk fried chicken was well seasoned and battered slaw dressed well and went all together with waffle Coffee pot de creme was good but could of used more coffee flavor Pecan pie sundae was also good but a little too sweet Would return for brunch and regular dinner,0

"More like 3.5 stars but I like to round up. I recently just got back from Japan so my standard for ramen is very high. This place meets my expectations. Very flavorful broth and interesting texture in the noodles. However the two hour wait is a bit ridiculous and at about 20 dollars a bowl with my extra toppings. It's on the pricey side. The decor here is very beautiful. Probably the most beautiful ramen place I've ever been to. The staff here is very attentive as well and always there to refill my water! However, I do have to add, while waiting outside I did witness one of the waitresses get into an altercation with a fellow patron. This is how the conversation went: Waitress: hey you didn't tip me! Patron: you don't deserve one Waitress: then don't ever come back!! I was really surprised and a little turned off by the how the waitress acted. To make matters worse it happened again with another patron about 5 min later! I can't believe this restaurant lets their staff act this way. Maybe it's normal here.

Tried this place for the first time today. I noticed it last week and I think its a few months old. The huge windows and clean open space caught my attention. This area totally needs a gourmet deli like this one. The prices are same as delis around here but food is well prepared and fresh not like the sub-standard food in this area. The hot/cold salad bar is $6.99/lb for quality that you would expect from Dishes or Mangia. I had some of the fish which was a bit overcooked but all the veggies I tried were really well seasoned and yummy. Breath mints highly recommended if you eat those garlic chips that they toss on the veggies. Definitely want to try out the different food stations. Plus they have a really cool 2nd floor seating area that overlooks the lower level.,4,Tried this place for the first time today I noticed it last week and I think its a few months old The huge windows and clean open space caught my attention This area totally needs a gourmet deli like this one The prices are same as delis around here but food is well prepared and fresh not like the substandard food in this area The hotcold salad bar is 699lb for quality that you would expect from Dishes or Mangia I had some of the fish which was a bit overcooked but all the veggies I tried were really well seasoned and yummy Breath mints highly recommended if you eat those garlic chips that they toss on the veggies Definitely want to try out the different food stations Plus they have a really cool 2nd floor seating area that overlooks the lower level,0
"Very cozy place with super friendly wait staff. Ate here twice - can't remember exactly what I had the first time, but it was seafood for both appetizer and main. The sauce for both dishes was exactly the same - faux pas ;-) Came back here a second time. Again, service was very friendly, had a great time, but again, food was just so so. Started with a very interesting appetizer - duck, fries, and cheese curds (wife's family from Wisconsin). Couldn't pass it up. Then had the fried chicken for my main course. Nothing was bad, but there are just much better options places in the hood (try Redhead's fried chicken...incredible!).

"Authentic Japanese Izakaya (and BYOB!) tucked into the busy East Village, highly recommended. As a curmudgeon, I'm not one to claim authenticity in Japanese food; my guests (originally Japanese) were and were impressed with food quality and authenticity. Place hits all of the right spots: not overcrowded, cozy, delicious food and great atmosphere. Reasonable prices for what you're getting. The waitstaff is attentive and friendly. The food hits all the right notes: fish carpaccio is phenomenal, as is (as many people have said) the beef. The addictive cabbage is--as advertised--addictive. Lots of subtle flavor, which is really the key to Japanese food. I really hope this place stays low key and doesn't get overrun by foodies who look for something to criticize everywhere on Yelp. This is a genuine, low key, solid and delicious meal where you can bring a group of friends or a date.

"Don't be fooled by the name. Bohemian has nothing bohemian about it. In fact, quite the opposite. Supposedly a member's only secret speakeasy bar/lounge, this place its already generating intense media interest. nymag.com/daily/food/200 www3.timeoutny.com/newyo Its soft opening happened a few weeks ago and I managed to snag a reservation the other night. With all the hype, secrecy, and difficulty getting a reservation, the owner/chef and the waitstaff were all extremely pleasant and accommodating. They even let me take pictures with my bulky SLR. After walking past a Wagyu only Japanese butcher shop and down a non-descript white hallway, you arrive at a unmarked glass door. Inside is a small space with only 4 tables and a bar area. They haven't gotten their liquor license yet so it was BYOB...and we were prepared. The menu is quite small but you'll have enough choices. We started off with a ""large"" bucket of oysters for $30 which ended up being a basket of 6 oysters. $5 an oyster?! Damn these better be some amazing oysters. Well, they were better than amazing, these were the tastiest, most flavorful oysters I've ever had. At $5 a pop though, I wouldn't be downing them by the dozen. We followed this with a cured meat appetizer which came with cured ham, spicy chorizo, spicy pork and some delicious garnish. A great dish when paired with the chilled crisp sake we had brought for our meal though I probably would have liked some crackers or bread to cut the saltiness. Next came the black cod. How can you ever pass up this dish at a Japanese restaurant? You better not here. Tender, moist and full of flavor, this dish melted in your mouth. It came served on a lush bed of mushrooms that seemed like they were sauteed in butter; a deadly good combination! Bohemian pays attention to all the details. The dishes are plated beautifully, the plates themselves are unique and even the garnishes are perfectly cooked and prepared. After a few rice balls, we ended our meal with the mini wagyu burgers. Two to an order, these babies were so good we ended up ordering it three times. My only complaint was that they were slightly overcooked, so please tell them you want it medium rare. OH, and these burgers are served with house pickled cauliflower which I am now obsessed with. Eaten after the burgers, they cut the grease and left your palate refreshed...and apparently ready for more burgers... All this and it was only $40/person after tax and tip! Overall this is a great spot to impress a date but with the small menu, I have a been-there-done-that feeling. However, I get the feeling that once they officially open, their menu is going to expand.

"I've lived in NYC for roughly 8 years now. When it comes to nutrition, most restaurants fall short somewhere in the cooking process, whether it's the marinade, the amount of butter used, or the temperature / duration of the cooking.

It employs the right ingredients, proportions, and cooking techniques that promote optimal health.

"I visited with my date on Sunday afternoon around 330, probably lucky timing because we could sit anywhere. But even at that time, there were other groups of people there too. The service was outstanding and up to par with what I've come to expect in Astoria. While the menu wasn't overwhelming with quantity, it took me forever to decide what sounded best. We went for a crostini with plums, olive, prosciutto and homemade goat cheese dressed with balsamic glaze- it was outstanding. Followed by the Bondi sandwich and the NSW sandwich for my gf. It was a huge sandwich (half became my dinner). Seasoned and grilled to perfection.

"I often stay at the Hilton, fly in late from California, and am amazed to consistently see throngs of people on line at midnight, 1AM, 2AM, and later for this food cart. In fact, the worst thing about this food cart is that there is almost always a line, and sometimes a line so long that you should realistically just go elsewhere. For example, once we gave up and walked over the Stage Deli for a 1AM snack because we didn't want to wait 30 minutes for a gyro. Food-wise, all I ever have is the gyro sandwich with both the white and the red-hot sauce (harissa).

My friend and I started with a bottle of wine and 4 small plates to share. The operative word here is ""small"" - if you have an appetite, you will definitely need to make a few different selections! Our server was VERY helpful and gave us great wine/food pairing recommendations! The Kale salad was tasty - a little too much garlic for me (and I LOVE garlic!). Would not recommend that for anyone having a romantic evening! We ordered the scallop special, too. Scallops were seared perfectly and pretty tasty. The mushroom tacos and cheese plate were probably our favorite plates - did not expect to like the mushroom tacos as much as we did! Spicy and delish! As other reviewers have said, the prices do add up pretty quickly and you'll probably spend more than your average wine & tapas bar.

I also like the fact that it has a very nice rubber grip on the top of the bladder, so if you want to carry your bladder in the back of a car, you don't have to worry about a zipper breaking. It is definitely a good addition to your bike.This is a very good holster. I like that it does not have any rubber on the holster. It is not as thick as a regular holster and it does not have any compression on the belt. The holster does not come with a clip on the back that is attached to the holster.

"like this place because they proudly state there is no MSG! Maybe I ordered the wrong thing because it was too overwhelming for me to enjoy, got the NIKU ramen, which was a whole lot of pork bits and a TON of garlic and raw onions. wow, definitely not kissing anyone, let alone talking to strangers in public after that meal!!! the chasu they make is delicious, however, on the way to the tiny slit of a room known as their bathroom, i saw clear blue bags with raw pork being tossed among staff members. Guess that ruined the magic, but seeing all that pork being manhandled that way was pretty gross! I would definitely come back and try the standard bowl of ramen, bc the one I ordered had way too much garlic, I am talking a whole bowl of garlic chips and raw grated garlic on top!",4,like this place because they proudly state there is no MSG Maybe I ordered the wrong thing because it was too overwhelming for me to enjoy got the NIKU ramen which was a whole lot of pork bits and a TON of garlic and raw onions wow definitely not kissing anyone let alone talking to strangers in public after that meal the chasu they make is delicious however on the way to the tiny slit of a room known as their bathroom i saw clear blue bags with raw pork being tossed among staff members Guess that ruined the magic but seeing all that pork being manhandled that way was pretty gross I would definitely come back and try the standard bowl of ramen bc the one I ordered had way too much garlic I am talking a whole bowl of garlic chips and raw grated garlic on top,0
"Yelpers, thank you for shouting out enough about Ippudo and those useful little hints that I was able to plan my visit to this place well. I made sure that we arrived just before it opened during lunch time. Though it was sunny, it was a bit chilly this morning so I was glad that the line was short. They were having problems in the kitchen so the wait was a bit longer and we were given complimentary salad. Nice touch. Our waitress looked tired, but the rest of the crew was very attentive and super friendly that it made up for our server's impatience; she behaved as if she's been working 16 hours and like I said, it just opened. I also get a kick out of them shouting before they seat you. Unique. We started with the Hirata Buns - everybody must start with Hirata Buns. They rival Momofuku's Pork Buns. They are so similar except for the lettuce in place of the cucumbers. Ippudo chars their pork bellies at the edges rendering them crispier. Akamaru Modern followed. So comforting. The ramen noodle has a bite to it, almost al dente. There wasn't a strong flavour that stood out - it was very delicate and mild. I liked it. Would I go back?

"Definitely one of my favorite restaurants in Brooklyn. I was a vegetarian for 7 years, and my first bite of meat was Diner's half a roasted chicken with mashed potatoes.....since then I haven't looked back. The moment you walk into Diner you know you are in for something special. The atmosphere in the old diner car is dimly lit, always bustling, and VERY hip. The servers sit right down with you and write the menu onto the table since the fare is always changing.

"I've been looking for a casual place nearby (2 stops on the train or fewer) that had some legit food and some solid, affordable drinks. Somewhere that is unpretentious and maybe there is a TV I can watch the Ranger/Yankee/Giants/Knicks game. Somewhere that has a great craft beer list and what do you know I stumbled upon this gem on Wednesday night. Beers were fantastic, bartenders seemed like they couldn't be bothered but I know from experience they were just busy. We had the BLT, the Kale salad and 6 sirracha-honey wings with buttermild dressing. Everything was great. Service was quick and seamless. I thought the line to order food was real long then after 5 minutes I realized it was just people standing there...no one was on line and I walked up and ordered right away. The Rangers game was on and the bar was packed. Luckily my girlfriend and I got a perfect set of seats right in view of the game. What was so great about this place was the other guests. We made friends with the couple sitting right next to us, and in front of us. People saying, excuse me? Thank you? Unbelievable! Of course the tallest man in North America happened to be standing right in front of the TV. We asked him to move and he was friendly about it. After working in restaurants for my entire life it was a nice change to not have a waiter come by to the table, check on us, clear the tables etc. Get in, order your drinks, order your food from the window, they bring it, eat and drink. I'd much rather come here than Manhattan where I can't go to a pub get a couple drinks and two burgers for less than $100. Overall I love the concept, food, and decor.

"It's often tough to find an Italian eatery that isn't either cheap/easy (pizza/heroes) or higher end/fancy (entrees at $20+). Giovanni's manages to slide right in that middle gap and provides some pretty solid food and ambiance. I don't think there's anything costing more that $12/14 (other than wine) and this includes some seafood dishes and veal. Bravo for them. Are you going to discover a new, esoteric dish that was eaten by Roman soldiers 400 years ago? Nope. Are you gonna get bread, a nice chunk of lasagne or a couple of veal pieces in a decent sauce that'll fill your tummy? Yes. It's a nice space with brick, tall windows and modern meets retro vibe. The staff are friendly and there's a full bar. Cocktails and beer were around $6. Wine, however, seemed a bit more complicated and higher priced (which is normal).

"My friend pulled me aside, said something and had me laughing the entire meal that Sunday brunch. More on that later. Though the crowd, the interior and the overall atmosphere may remind you of the 5th Arrondissement, the food is nothing but. I only came here for their so-called Black Label burger, and it's not even noon. And at a whopping $26, I expect to be totally blown away. It better make my eyes roll back in ecstasy. It should make my feet curl in delight. It must satisfy and satiate me to nirvana, period. I T D I D N ' T. Not even close. It may have been 'perfectly' cooked medium with a fair amount of crust; it may have been sandwiched between two slices of custom-made toasted brioche; it may have been - as mentioned by a number of so-called 'foodie' - drizzled in clarified butter during the entire cooking process; it may have been succulently juicy and topped with caramelized onions; and it may have even come with tenderly crispy pomme frites, but in the end, the Black Label burger lacked depth and flavor. So amiss and faulty my burger was that I had to scoop the hollandaise sauce from my friend's Latkes and smother my burger with it. Now back to what my friend told me: Friend: You know my date's Bulgarian, right? Me: Yes. Why? Friend: Well, he told me that minet means blowjob in Bulgarian. How appropriate is that.

"I took a date here after walking the highline. It was a great night. The place is very intimate (we came on a Wednesday night). There looks like a place for a band to play, but they were not playing when we were there. We ordered the fried calamari, Emilia pizza, brussels sprouts with pancetta, and truffle fries. The calamari was one of the best fried calamari I've ever had. There wasn't too much breading, nor was there too much oil. The Emilia pizza was a thin crust yummy pie. I had no clue how prosciutto would taste on a pizza, but it was amazing! The truffle fries is a sin. Nothing can taste that good. They were just... deep-fried and seasoned to perfection.. I just.. I'm salivating just writing about it. My date thought it would be a healthy balance to get brussels sprouts. I thought this was quite odd (you know, being that it was a date and all), but long story short, they tasted amazing too! Perfectly charred and seasoned. The waitress was also very friendly. She was able to quickly set up a birthday calzone (complete with a birthday candle). The nutella calzone was also very delicious, though probably a bit too big. This is something you share with 2-4 people. Lastly, we also got the spiced sangria. This one tasted interesting. You could definitely taste the hints of ginger. For the ingredients, it's priced as a typical NYC cocktail. However, I found it's just a bit much for a sangria.",5,I took a date here after walking the highline It was a great night The place is very intimate we came on a Wednesday night There looks like a place for a band to play but they were not playing when we were there We ordered the fried calamari Emilia pizza brussels sprouts with pancetta and truffle fries The calamari was one of the best fried calamari Ive ever had There wasnt too much breading nor was there too much oil The Emilia pizza was a thin crust yummy pie I had no clue how prosciutto would taste on a pizza but it was amazing The truffle fries is a sin Nothing can taste that good They were just deepfried and seasoned to perfection I just Im salivating just writing about it My date thought it would be a healthy balance to get brussels sprouts I thought this was quite odd you know being that it was a date and all but long story short they tasted amazing too Perfectly charred and seasoned The waitress was also very friendly She was able to quickly set up a birthday calzone complete with a birthday candle The nutella calzone was also very delicious though probably a bit too big This is something you share with 24 people Lastly we also got the spiced sangria This one tasted interesting You could definitely taste the hints of ginger For the ingredients its priced as a typical NYC cocktail However I found its just a bit much for a sangria,0

It all began in line where at least 2 parties ahead of us left when they got fed up with being ignored by the guy taking the numbers down. when seated it took 1/2 hour for the order to be taken and the place wasnt even packed. Had to ask 3x for my drink, the plate still had grease stuck on from whoever used it before and when I asked for a napkin our waiter was on his cellphone saying to hold on (10-15mins later got a napkin). Grimaldi's service is below what is acceptable. Would recommend visiting Lombardi's instead! On a side note: tried the pizza place next door and it is actually better than grimaldis as well!

It definitely lives up to the fame and recognition. Service was impeccable, atmosphere was classy and sophisticated without being overly pretentious, and well, the food...where to start? No complaints, only praises. For the ingredients they could afford to serve you at restaurant week prices, they did an absolute stellar job--both in taste and in presentation. You can't go wrong with any of the menu choices, but I highly recommend the chilled zucchini soup and pan-roasted skate wing. Dessert certainly does not disappoint either.

"Came here for brunch with a few friends and was able to book a table of 8 on pretty short notice. It is a small space so I don't think you can typically get away with that. It's a cute setup with memorable little trinkets and interior coloring scheme (lots of red) but I was impressed more with the overall experience. Brunch is a flat $14 and comes with bottomless coffee, a mimosa (if you ask for just OJ, they'll hold back on the bubbly), and an entree off their menu. I opted for the pretzel chicken and waffles while a few others ordered a mix of dishes, mostly egg based. The pretzel chicken was an interesting idea as it was literally crusted with pretzels and pretty tough to cut. They tasted alright but the waffles had a nice texture and satisfying multigrain taste. One egg dish came with sweet potato hash which was quite good too. Overall the meal is a good value and it is a chill spot to eat and enjoy conversation with friends. They even had a scoutmob for $15 off, making the meal a steal. I saw lots of reviews below complaining about the music but I don't remember it bothering me at all.",5,Came here for brunch with a few friends and was able to book a table of 8 on pretty short notice It is a small space so I dont think you can typically get away with that Its a cute setup with memorable little trinkets and interior coloring scheme lots of red but I was impressed more with the overall experience Brunch is a flat 14 and comes with bottomless coffee a mimosa if you ask for just OJ theyll hold back on the bubbly and an entree off their menu I opted for the pretzel chicken and waffles while a few others ordered a mix of dishes mostly egg based The pretzel chicken was an interesting idea as it was literally crusted with pretzels and pretty tough to cut They tasted alright but the waffles had a nice texture and satisfying multigrain taste One egg dish came with sweet potato hash which was quite good too Overall the meal is a good value and it is a chill spot to eat and enjoy conversation with friends They even had a scoutmob for 15 off making the meal a steal I saw lots of reviews below complaining about the music but I dont remember it bothering me at all,0

"Oh man, fond memories of this sushi place. They've got a GREAT deal for the pre fix! Highly encourage you to get it. I think when I was there it was like $21 for the pre fix, nicely filling, and came with a green tea mochi at the end. You can pick from a selection of fish. I just remember that I had one clam type of thing, and it was so fresh and crisp. I don't think I've ever felt such a texture in my mouth from clam before! White fishes (Japanese traditional fishes) are superb as well. If budget would allow, I would go here all the time. Sake selection is great too. Cold Sakes are the way to go, and they'll pair a sake for you. Hint: if they see you eating the sushi like with your fingers, popping a whole piece into your mouth delicately, they'll secretly bring over a nicely shaped wet napkin so you can clean your fingers in between an indulgence. They'll tell you what's great if you ask. And they know their fish well. Don't fool around with extra soy It'll muddle the fish and rice. You can really savor the flavor of the expertly prepared rice and fish as they meld together.",5,Oh man fond memories of this sushi place Theyve got a GREAT deal for the pre fix Highly encourage you to get it I think when I was there it was like 21 for the pre fix nicely filling and came with a green tea mochi at the end You can pick from a selection of fish I just remember that I had one clam type of thing and it was so fresh and crisp I dont think Ive ever felt such a texture in my mouth from clam before White fishes Japanese traditional fishes are superb as well If budget would allow I would go here all the time Sake selection is great too Cold Sakes are the way to go and theyll pair a sake for you Hint if they see you eating the sushi like with your fingers popping a whole piece into your mouth delicately theyll secretly bring over a nicely shaped wet napkin so you can clean your fingers in between an indulgence Theyll tell you whats great if you ask And they know their fish well Dont fool around with extra soy Itll muddle the fish and rice You can really savor the flavor of the expertly prepared rice and fish as they meld together,0

I have slender legs and have trouble finding boots that fit my calves without making me look like I'm standing in two buckets. These are fine tucked into skinny jeans. The heel is a reasonable height, and they are pretty boots. Contrary to what one reviewer said, I believe the suede portion is real but the buckel trim is man-made. The boot does say ""leather/manmade upper). They didn't have the boot in 7.5 so I got size 7 and they fit fine.

"Battery Park was the last neighborhood in NYC that I thought would be graced by Shake Shack's presence. The burgers are juicy & amazing, I bet vegetarians come here to cheat (if they don't, they should). You can come here dressed in anything you would like from pajamas to cocktail dresses. During the day expect big crowds, it's practically attached to Goldman Sachs. Late night hours expect men (eye candy if a man in a suit does it for you) who work ridiculous hours to come in, watch the game, and devour some meat. The tables are shiny wood, made from the floor of an old bowling alley in Brooklyn. There are lots of seats outside, plenty of indoor booths, and some bar stools in the center. Flat screen TVs indoors are always playing the latest sporting event. Those who do not order a drink are the regulars of the neighborhood or the foodies, they know that water is free and the cups are by the condiments so skip buying the bottle of water or 3 dollar soda and save for a shake. The wait time can be up to 30 minutes for your food, so sit around and enjoy the wifi, a 3 hour wait would be worth it. What should you get? The double shackburger. What will happen? You will become an addict and have me to thank.

"I'm being generous with the 2 stars only because this place deserves a little more than just 1. Having been to Amy Ruth's in Harlem, I was more than ecstatic at trying a chicken and red velvet waffle dish (main motivation for visit). Needless to say Soco was disappointing. When you think of Southern cooking and soul food you think of flavorful and savory, so good but so bad because they clog your arteries type of dishes. Not this time. The gumbo appetizer had a nice touch of spice, but still needed salt. When my chicken and waffles came, the waffle tasted like a regular buttermilk waffle that was on the dry side. As for the chicken, some would argue the Colonel at KFC prepares his better. Again there was a lack of flavor and an abundance of cooking oil in the batter. The lack of seasoning continued to be a trend on the menu as my mother's ""pecan crusted"" pork chops were merely chops whose breading must've turned into tasteless mush by the time they got from the kitchen to our table. Soco is described as southern fusion cuisine, but somewhere in the fusion the south must've made an illegal U-turn and headed back home. Positives: The overall ambiance was nice, music a little loud where you had to have a screaming match with your party, but at least the bathrooms were clean and the hand soap smelled yummy.",2,Im being generous with the 2 stars only because this place deserves a little more than just 1 Having been to Amy Ruths in Harlem I was more than ecstatic at trying a chicken and red velvet waffle dish main motivation for visit Needless to say Soco was disappointing When you think of Southern cooking and soul food you think of flavorful and savory so good but so bad because they clog your arteries type of dishes Not this time The gumbo appetizer had a nice touch of spice but still needed salt When my chicken and waffles came the waffle tasted like a regular buttermilk waffle that was on the dry side As for the chicken some would argue the Colonel at KFC prepares his better Again there was a lack of flavor and an abundance of cooking oil in the batter The lack of seasoning continued to be a trend on the menu as my mothers pecan crusted pork chops were merely chops whose breading mustve turned into tasteless mush by the time they got from the kitchen to our table Soco is described as southern fusion cuisine but somewhere in the fusion the south mustve made an illegal Uturn and headed back home Positives The overall ambiance was nice music a little loud where you had to have a screaming match with your party but at least the bathrooms were clean and the hand soap smelled yummy,0

"Having made the mistake of ordering mounds of meat during a Fette Sau excursion, we adopted a more cautious strategy upon tackling Mighty Quinn's Barbeque. The place is light and airy, casual and - thankfully - devoid of the throngs of individuals who eagerly await their meat at other popular barbeque establishments in the city, though this was a Thursday night at 7 p.m. and so I am sure the situation is rather more chaotic on the weekends. Greeted by the typical counter at which the staff cut your chosen meat and throw it in a cardboard box (familiar to those of you who frequent Smorgasburg), we opted for single servings of the pulled pork and brisket, which we decided to split. Said fare is more than adequate to satiate your recommended daily allowance of protein for many a day. Furthermore, the inclusion of coleslaw, peppers, pickles and other sides to accompany the meal was certainly a welcomed addition - a complementary supplement to the dish at no extra cost. Bonus points for that little novelty. The Food: With our trays loaded up, we got down to the task at hand. Unfortunately, the meal failed to impress me, especially the brisket which was rather dry and tough, which was certainly in stark contrast to Fette Sau which shone in that regard (though not much else). With a liberal application of barbeque sauce, it was slightly more palatable but, considering the songs of praise for the brisket at Mighty Quinn's Barbeque, I was sorely disappointed. It is, however, wholly possible that it was an off night. The pulled pork was a treat and, though it failed to ""wow"" me, it was undoubtedly tasty. Rating from my company: My friend said he would give the place 3.75 stars and that, if he lived in the area, he would probably be a regular. You cannot say that I don't provide fair and balanced accounts of my eating excursions. Conclusion: Mighty Quinn's Barbeque's strength lies in its accessibility - it brings barbecue to the masses in a quick, reasonably priced and convenient form. For those of you who live in the East Village area and need your fix of whatever meaty delight every couple of weeks, I can easily see how this would become a neighborhood institution. However, the food is of an ""A-OK"" standard and is certainly not noteworthy: this is a decent barbecue establishment at which you may grab a beer with friends in a low-key setting. Go to Mighty Quinn's Babeque with the knowledge that it may not quite live up to the mouth-watering hype.

"My friends and I first went in because it seemed like a typical dive bar that we would like but it ended up being a surprising find in the financial district. The food was delicious. I have had the fried mac and cheese, crispy fried rice, and the pork belly sandwich at different times and they were all great. What really makes this bar unique is the atmosphere. Fishmarket is a bar where you actually have that thought, ""this is my local bar"" which is very rare in the city. Jeff and the other bartenders are so welcoming and fun. They make it so it seems you are just hanging out having drinks with some old friends. Another bonus, was the round of Jameson Jeff had given to the whole bar to keep the fun going. You will always leave with a good time and some great new friends.

"I wish i could give you 6 stars. This place was fantastic. We were lucky enough to sit in the front area and save about 60% of our bill. The Meatball is amazing (One giant meatball fille with cheese). But to be honest, they make the best chicken breast i have ever had. They suvee the chicken breast so it is extremely moist and tender but cooked, then they flash sear it on a wood flame to create a contrast of textures with crunchy and moist (Friggin Amazing) and only 18 bucks! They served the chicken break over a chicken stock reduction sauce. The waiter explained that they don't use butter or any thickening agents, but they reduce stock by about 80% just to go some perfect pure tasting broth. Damn it was delicious. Wines - I hate drinking wine at restaurants because they usally aren't very good, or they are ridiuclkously overpriced, or you have to buy a whole friggin bottle. Gramercy does wine correct. Every wine we had was phenomenal (Cab, Rose, Pinot, Zin, Champagne). They let you purchase half glasses which is awesome! You can definitely tell that they put a lot of effot into making sure every wine is superior. The same goes with their cheeses as they get tons of imported cheese.

"Will never go back!!! Owner is a complete idiot from when he opened his reservation book, on the day I stopped in to make a reservation. He was a show off, condescending, like he was doing me a favor to give me a reservation for a Friday night at the table in the window. When we arrived on time, and waited more than 1/2 an hour for our reserved table in the window, we found that it was occupied with guests just beginning their meal. The owner says, ""don't worry they will be done soon. I'll get them out"" I was embarrassed since I had 3 others with me and it was my suggestion to eat there. Finally after the awkward and long standing up outside in the street wait we were seated, ordered our meals, and in the midst of eating the owner kept coming over and asking if we were missing something from the table (wine). He was actually billigerent kept coming over half drunk, ""you sure you aren't missing something?"" Finally we left without dessert, just could not take him anylonger, the loud music which he would not lower and his disrespectful behavior towards us, his clients.

"Came here twice: one for the bar and one for the food. Bar: It's a very relaxed bar with slow music playing in the background. I would go here after a stressful day of work to unwind and relax with some cocktails. Most of their mixed drinks are quite interesting as they incorporate some sort of Peruvian or Spanish twist. They are quite strong, but I like my drinks a little stronger so I liked them. If you're looking for something sweeter, the sangria is amazing. It almost tastes like juice! The bartenders are pretty attentive and quick. Even when it was busy, they came over to me and fixed me up with a drink fast. Restaurant: The wait for the food is not a short one, but I forgot about it once my food came out. I ordered the steak skewer appetizer that came with huge kernels of corn! The steak was cooked a bit more than I like, but it's a skewer so I can understand. It was still good, but next time, I would get the ceviche. I shared a whole rotisserie chicken with my friend and surprisingly, we managed to finish all of it. It was SO good that we just kept eating and eating and by the end, we could barely move. The skin is thin, crispy, flavorful and the chicken meat was extremely juicy. Even the breasts were moist! Of course, the green ahi sauce helped and if no one was looking, I could have drank that with a straw. It's not as spicy as I like it, but it's creamy and super flavorful. Tbh, I have a Peruvian friend who makes homemade ahi sauce and pio pio can't compare, but it's one of the best sauces I've had in a restaurant. If you liked this place, but are looking for cheaper prices, there's a chicken place in woodside that does it just as good. The breast is not as moist, but it's darn good. It's called Peking BBQ and their green sauce is also addicting. A bit more watery, but all the flavors are there.

"After leaving the Brooklyn Museum yesterday around 6pm, my family and I stopped in Catfish bc of the overwhelmingly positive Yelp reviews. The restaurant is cozy, but not invasive of one's personal space. There was no host greeting at the door so we had to ask to be seated, but the service was really awesome besides that. My meal, the roasted chicken, came out 20 minutes after everyone else's and was not worth the wait. It was extremely lemony despite the description stating the dish was herb-roasted. Everyone else seemed to enjoy their food though. And the server bought me a drink bc of how long I had to wait for my food. Overall, Catfish was a decent experience, but I'd never go back.

Nothing beats fresh noodles. We also tried both dumplings, the fried and boiled. I really can't say which one is better. I generally have a preference, but this time I'm indecisive. I love how the dumpling skin is not too thick. And I really liked the chives and pork filling. Perfect balance of filling to skin. Oh and I can't forget the garlic soy sauce that you pour over the dumplings. Mmmmm...sooo delish! I heard the prices went up, but that's what happens when the prices of all ingredients in the world go up. Dumplings are 4 for $1 and noodles are $4.50. Still a bargain in NYC!

"Go here!! I've been passing this place for months and I finally wandered in. What the hell was I thinking not coming earlier!! Cute, romantic, cozy, and well priced. Had the Espinaci salad. Perfectly crisp spinach, and the right balance of parm cheese, walnuts, and vinaigrette. They waiter was SUPER attentive and nice. They kept bring us fresh crisp bread for us to much on in between goodies. I had the cavatappi pasta as an entree. Perfect al dente pasta and really fresh mushrooms and spinach and tomatoes mixed in. Perfect sized portion too. Not those humongous- heart stopping fattening pasta portions you can get from other restaurants. This was the perfect portion to make anyone feel satiated. Since it was almost the end of the night, the waiter gifted us with a free dessert, the chocolate mousse, which was definitely rich and good.

"I really like this place. It is always a bit of a wait but I don't mind. The bar there is small and but good place to wait if you can have a seat. Pretty good cocktails, intersting wines, good bear and also molson canadian. Or you could go to a million other bars around the corner and wait. The place is small, charming, kind of contrived - but so is every restaurant in new york, and it's not bad so I'll let it slide. It's pretty cozy and loud. a great reason to live in new york is restaurants that are as jovial as this. the food is awesome. Mostly pretty heavy. The pork hock is insane, the side dishes are good, the specials are good. The skate is also amazing. I love the cornichons with the bread. Desserts are pretty simple but really delicious.

"There's this little shack-like kiosk that goes by unnoticed by many. Or at least, I myself, made the mistake of walking by this place, and was told by a passerby it was just behind me. There's a little counter opened to the sidewalk where you put your order in. After you get your order, you can grab some complimentary water from the big thermos-like jug supplied with plastic cups just to the left of the main entrance. Make your way up the metal spiral staircase, and you'll be taken to a rather small room with bar-stool like seats surrounding the perimeter of the room. Small bottles of Sriracha are available all over the tables. On one side, it overlooks 12th St. On the other side, it overlooks a parking garage. There's some cool graffiti along the glass and interesting reggae and rap music playing. It's a cool place, except for the 3-4 small flies that were buzzing around while we were eating our meal. The Pork Belly sandwich, their best-seller, was sold out, so I asked for the next best thing, which the gentleman had unhesitatingly said was the Pulled Duroc Pork ($7.75) Sandwich. What I got was a small 6-8"" sandwich, filled with pork and with ingredients very similar to a bahn mi: cucumber, pickled carrots, cilantro, and chili mayo served on bread baked by Parisi Bakery. The pork was somewhat tender yet a little dry. The spiced honey, which was more sweet with a hint of heat, did help with the dryness. And the cucumber, pickled carrots, and cilantro all added a nice refreshing crispness to the sandwich. The bread was crisp and airy, but no where as close to resembling the Vietnamese french-baguette like bahn mi bread used. But I was far from impressed by their second best-seller. I did find this one of the messiest sandwiches I ate in a while, as my fingers were drenched in grease and gravy, making for a very very messy sandwich. Luckily they had several napkin dispensers on the table so that I was able to clean my dirty paws after every bite. I also tried the Grilled Skirt Steak ($9.00) seasoned with crushed coriander and peppercorn. The skirt steak was charred on the outside but the inside was still very bloody red, ever so subtlety purple. The marinade used on the steak was good, but I still couldn't get over the fact of how chewy the steak was. I would find myself chewing for a minute or two, and just swallowing it, because it was too tiresome to keep chewing. It also included the standard ingredients of cucumber, pickled carrots, cilantro and chili mayo. But I did not enjoy this sandwich one bit, except for the fact that it was much cleaner, and did not require tons of napkin cleaning like the Pulled Duroc Pork did. Luckily, we ordered a Boylan Soda ($1.75) which helped to make things easier to swallow. After making our way down, we spotted some cleanse wipes by the cashier. I grabbed two to clean my fingers, and they definitely proved helpful. For what it was worth, I felt that the sandwiches were overpriced and small. I'd rather stick to a traditional bahn mi for half the price (aka Bahn Mi Saigon in NYC, JoJu in Queens), which has just about the same ingredients but are bigger and a lot tastier. I won't go out of my way to come back here again, but if I do, I'm hoping to try their much talked-about Five-Spice Glazed Pork Belly ($7.75) sandwich.",3,Theres this little shacklike kiosk that goes by unnoticed by many Or at least I myself made the mistake of walking by this place and was told by a passerby it was just behind me Theres a little counter opened to the sidewalk where you put your order in After you get your order you can grab some complimentary water from the big thermoslike jug supplied with plastic cups just to the left of the main entrance Make your way up the metal spiral staircase and youll be taken to a rather small room with barstool like seats surrounding the perimeter of the room Small bottles of Sriracha are available all over the tables On one side it overlooks 12th St On the other side it overlooks a parking garage Theres some cool graffiti along the glass and interesting reggae and rap music playing Its a cool place except for the 34 small flies that were buzzing around while we were eating our meal The Pork Belly sandwich their bestseller was sold out so I asked for the next best thing which the gentleman had unhesitatingly said was the Pulled Duroc Pork 775 Sandwich What I got was a small 68 sandwich filled with pork and with ingredients very similar to a bahn mi cucumber pickled carrots cilantro and chili mayo served on bread baked by Parisi Bakery The pork was somewhat tender yet a little dry The spiced honey which was more sweet with a hint of heat did help with the dryness And the cucumber pickled carrots and cilantro all added a nice refreshing crispness to the sandwich The bread was crisp and airy but no where as close to resembling the Vietnamese frenchbaguette like bahn mi bread used But I was far from impressed by their second bestseller I did find this one of the messiest sandwiches I ate in a while as my fingers were drenched in grease and gravy making for a very very messy sandwich Luckily they had several napkin dispensers on the table so that I was able to clean my dirty paws after every bite I also tried the Grilled Skirt Steak 900 seasoned with crushed coriander and peppercorn The skirt steak was charred on the outside but the inside was still very bloody red ever so subtlety purple The marinade used on the steak was good but I still couldnt get over the fact of how chewy the steak was I would find myself chewing for a minute or two and just swallowing it because it was too tiresome to keep chewing It also included the standard ingredients of cucumber pickled carrots cilantro and chili mayo But I did not enjoy this sandwich one bit except for the fact that it was much cleaner and did not require tons of napkin cleaning like the Pulled Duroc Pork did Luckily we ordered a Boylan Soda 175 which helped to make things easier to swallow After making our way down we spotted some cleanse wipes by the cashier I grabbed two to clean my fingers and they definitely proved helpful For what it was worth I felt that the sandwiches were overpriced and small Id rather stick to a traditional bahn mi for half the price aka Bahn Mi Saigon in NYC JoJu in Queens which has just about the same ingredients but are bigger and a lot tastier I wont go out of my way to come back here again but if I do Im hoping to try their much talkedabout FiveSpice Glazed Pork Belly 775 sandwich,0

We actually ordered 1 additional - salad greens n we were all stuffed!! They accommodated our portion - I ordered sliders n they added another slider so everyone could sample! Ribs were insanely finger liking good n fall of the bone tender, I don't eat shellfish, but I was told by my friends the scallops were off the chart great!! I ordered the gnocchi n it was melt in ur mouth ricotta smooth. We were determined to get dessert - the bacon donuts n key lime pie....I'm not partial to key lime pie n the graham cracker crust was heavenly!! The donuts as strange as it sounded to me worked! I knew though anything with bacon will just work...the only complaint I can say were even though drinks were tasty they def were not strong which I think is typical...also our meal with 9 dishes, two deserts, n 5 drinks was absolutely and incredibly reasonable!!

"I guarantee you that if you take a date here, you will get a another date. This place is cozy, romantic, and very sexy. They are having a special during Brooklyn Restaurant Week. An appetizer, an entree and dessert for $25. You cannot beat this deal. We started off with mejillones al provenzal (mussels with shallots, parsley and white wine) and caserola de pulpo (octopus casserole with lima beans and aioli) . Both dishes were extremely fresh and flavorful. It felt absolutely sinful to devour each morsel. For entrees, my friend had the churrasco (skirt steak and chimichurri) and I ordered the pescado en papillote. The fish of the day was pollock. I don't even like steak and when I had a piece of the steak, it was entirely blissful. Well cooked and thoroughly seasoned. The fish was fresh and smoky. The best part of the meal were the desserts. The dulce de leche flan was orgasmic. Really it was that good. It was very thick and oozing with caramel flavor. The torta chocolate was also amazing. I felt so guilty afterwards. But hey you only live once... I had a Pilsen, an Uruguayan beer, and also a glass of sangria. If you come before 7pm, they have happy hour specials. I think by going here, I might have committed 5 of the 7 cardinal sins. I'll let you figure out which ones they are.

"This place is open 24/7 so already I'm a fan. I'm one of those people that get rare food cravings. And where I currently live there's just no spots that serve a good empanada. So when I went back to New York for the holidays I knew I had to hunt this place down. I admit, I don't often go past 42nd street if I don't have to. Mostly because I'm broke and can't afford shopping in Manhattan so I don't like to tempt the tiger or whatever adage people use to keep themselves from shopping. Anyways, it was morning and I found myself in Manhattan running a couple of random errands and decided while I'm in the city already might as well try them out. Luckily I got there before what I can only imagine a lunch rush would look like. The girls at the counter were really nice. I took probably 10 minutes just looking at the menu, which I have to say is pretty extensive. I'm from Brooklyn so the prices were a little bit higher for my tastes. In BK empanadas would cost maybe $1-2 bucks tops. But for Hell's Kitchen in mid-town Manhattan it's probably one of the cheaper places to eat. I ordered a few beef, chicken and cheese & broccoli ones. With a mixture of both corn and wheat pastry. I waited perhaps 10 minutes for them which is pretty quick service. Being a takeout order I actually had one right after I left the place. And it was pretty damn good. Not doughy and definitely not skimpy on the fillings Empanada Mama satisfied a month long craving in a matter of minutes. Crispy and flaky crust. Robust and delicious on the inside. I prefer the wheat to the corn shell and the beef and chicken was really nicely seasoned. I stuck to mostly the traditional items but next time I pass by I think I'll go a little more adventurous. They have so many different ones to choose from they literally have something for everyone. Thank you guys for making my empanada dreams come true.",4,This place is open 247 so already Im a fan Im one of those people that get rare food cravings And where I currently live theres just no spots that serve a good empanada So when I went back to New York for the holidays I knew I had to hunt this place down I admit I dont often go past 42nd street if I dont have to Mostly because Im broke and cant afford shopping in Manhattan so I dont like to tempt the tiger or whatever adage people use to keep themselves from shopping Anyways it was morning and I found myself in Manhattan running a couple of random errands and decided while Im in the city already might as well try them out Luckily I got there before what I can only imagine a lunch rush would look like The girls at the counter were really nice I took probably 10 minutes just looking at the menu which I have to say is pretty extensive Im from Brooklyn so the prices were a little bit higher for my tastes In BK empanadas would cost maybe 12 bucks tops But for Hells Kitchen in midtown Manhattan its probably one of the cheaper places to eat I ordered a few beef chicken and cheese broccoli ones With a mixture of both corn and wheat pastry I waited perhaps 10 minutes for them which is pretty quick service Being a takeout order I actually had one right after I left the place And it was pretty damn good Not doughy and definitely not skimpy on the fillings Empanada Mama satisfied a month long craving in a matter of minutes Crispy and flaky crust Robust and delicious on the inside I prefer the wheat to the corn shell and the beef and chicken was really nicely seasoned I stuck to mostly the traditional items but next time I pass by I think Ill go a little more adventurous They have so many different ones to choose from they literally have something for everyone Thank you guys for making my empanada dreams come true,0

When we arrived, the restaurant was already a little busy but tables were clearing up so we were seated within 5 minutes. My friend and I started off with the grilled corn. I chose the shrimp tacos as my entree. I'm not a fan of corn usually but seeing the recognition it gets in the restaurant and in the reviews did not hesitate me to give it a try- AND OH MY, was it delicious! So savory, sweet, yet salty (not too salty). Writing this is making my mouth water as I type! Our entrees came within minutes of our corn and we had to do a bit of rearranging to our table since the tables are SO tiny (if you're seated at a two-person table). Most entrees come with yellow rice and black beans. The whole entree was fantastic. The second fish taco ended up drooping a bit so I finished that one off with a fork. It got a little messy! Overall, service was nothing exceptional but the food was fantastic.

"Yeah what's all the fuss about? The service here was very warm and polite, the staff is wonderful. That said, this place is overpriced, overrated, and I don't understand why this place is touted as the new best Thai place in town, uh not!!!! Yea ok it's northern Thai cuisine, whatever, if you like Thai, you will like northern Thai, to me it's not like an extra layer of acquired taste. Anyways on to the food, the one amazing dish we had was the pok pok papaya salad. The papaya was oozing with flavours this papaya was prepped in a way that made it absorb the dressing better. I liked it very much, this was a+ for taste and execution. I would even venture to say it is better than sipraphai in queens, and that is saying something, because to me sipraphai is as close to Thailand as you're gonna get in NYC. The Vietnamese fish sauce chicken wings, were good. However I found them to be too sweet, and the fish sauce flavour was weak. It should be the other way around slightly more salty and less sweet. It was good but not enough fish sauce. The ribs were decent, the boar collar meat was ok. All in all, it felt weird, the food was Thai, but the experience of eating here seemed transformed somehow and it didn't feel like going to a Thai restaurant. It was clean and that's a plus for sure, but in Thailand it always feels sketch and maybe that adds to the romance of it all...",3,Yeah whats all the fuss about The service here was very warm and polite the staff is wonderful That said this place is overpriced overrated and I dont understand why this place is touted as the new best Thai place in town uh not Yea ok its northern Thai cuisine whatever if you like Thai you will like northern Thai to me its not like an extra layer of acquired taste Anyways on to the food the one amazing dish we had was the pok pok papaya salad The papaya was oozing with flavours this papaya was prepped in a way that made it absorb the dressing better I liked it very much this was a for taste and execution I would even venture to say it is better than sipraphai in queens and that is saying something because to me sipraphai is as close to Thailand as youre gonna get in NYC The Vietnamese fish sauce chicken wings were good However I found them to be too sweet and the fish sauce flavour was weak It should be the other way around slightly more salty and less sweet It was good but not enough fish sauce The ribs were decent the boar collar meat was ok All in all it felt weird the food was Thai but the experience of eating here seemed transformed somehow and it didnt feel like going to a Thai restaurant It was clean and thats a plus for sure but in Thailand it always feels sketch and maybe that adds to the romance of it all,0

"I can't believe its taken me this long to write a review for this place. Every time I come no matter what time of day it's the same crew working. Quality food at affordable prices. I usually just order a meat and house fried rice. The fried rice is delicious and unless you seriously want to stuff yourself you will have enough to take home. I recently came for their lunch special and ordered the seafood lunch special. I forget exactly what it was called but it was an assortment of sea food for $8. I think it was the second item listed on the lunch special page. Anyways this is my new favorite dish. The reason why I'm rating them as 5 stars is because of the chili oil they serve (hard to find in the U.S. and something I grew up with), consistent quality and down to earth vibe.

"Prosperity Dumpling has a very tight opposite bar style seating area which works for eating a few dumplings and listening to that sweatshirt wearing guy with the baggy jeans and beat up etnies talking to his weird or disinterested girlfriend who's adorned with glasses, beads, necklaces, bracelets, earings, chains, keychains, do-dads, hair clips, headbands, silly bands, and 3 intergalactic style shoelaces in each one of her grey/brown shoes - mid way through their interaction another woman came in, placed an order and sensed the same thing I did in these two, she pulled up a stool next to mine, each of us caught the other's eye and we smiled then sat back enjoying the performance happening on the other side of the tiny tiled restaurant until our dumplings were ready.

"I went here for my birthday. I had called earlier in the week to make reservations. The lady who answered the phone said that if it was 5 people or less that I didn't need to make a reservation. Ok. I roll up on that Friday night. I'm greeted by a hostess, and she asks me how many people. I say 5. She asks, ""Did you make a reservation?"" I say no. Then she looks at me funny ( as if ""Ughh, i don't know if we can seat you"") But she grabs some menus and brings us over to the last table of the restaurant, the one before you go outside to their garden seating. I wanted to ask her if we could be seated outside, but she disappeared before we got the chance to even sit down. The rest of the night went pretty okay. The waitress was alright. The portions were small for the price you pay. Also towards the end, my dad was debating whether or not to try the Mate. I told him he probably would not like it cause its bitter tea ( Ive had it in Argentina when I studied abroad) But i said let me ask the waitress if they have any different Mate flavors. Cause in Argentina they had an Orange flavor which tastes delicious and the taste isn't so bitter. So I ask the waitress, and she seemed confused as if to say, ""No we dont have any other flavors."" So I proceeded to tell her that mate comes in different flavors such as orange, and she then said in what seemed to be an annoyed tone, ""Oh I dunno, all we have is that"". So i was like okay. And we ordered dessert. We had the banana one. It was very good. Only that its tiny. On our way out, my brother went outside to the garden area to check it out, and he was like come here so I could see it too. At that moment a hostess passed by escorting a dinner party down to the outdoor tables, and she verbally pushed us out of the way.

BLACK BEANS. F***. But you know what? As I continued to have at it, against my better judgement, these beans started growing on me.

"This is a great place for tourists to get the ""Chinatown experience"": the service is sloppy and brusque, the atmosphere is nil, the food is reliably good, the price is right. If you live in NYC and want xiao long bao, then Nan Xiang (yelp.com/biz/nan-xiang-d) is a better bet. The soup dumplings at Joe's Shanghai were good, but there are lots of obvious tourist concessions. For example, what should have been a mix of black vinegar and julienned ginger to accompany the dumplings was instead shockingly mild and sweet, with no heavy, vinegary tartness. I guess they think tourists will soak their dumplings in sauce and then be turned off by what should be an abrasive flavor. Also, this location uses shredded cabbage to line the steam baskets, presumably because xiao long bao newbies may rip the dumpling skins when plucking them from atop whole cabbage leaves. Convenient, but this meant that there were unnecessary cabbage bits on the underside of my dumpling. Blah! The crab soup dumplings are very starkly crab-flavored, more than most other xiao long bao establishments. The rest of the food I've tried here is decent and filling: the cold noodles are nicely coated in soy and sesame paste with barely a hint of vegetable, and curiously tossed tableside. The jellyfish is nice and crisp. The scallion pancake is fresh, flavorful, and not too greasy. Despite the adjustments made for those new to xiao long bao, the food here in general is better than at the Joe's Shanghai location in Flushing (yelp.com/biz/joes-shangh), which verges on too greasy. If you come in a group of fewer than 6, you're probably going to be sharing a table with another party. This kind of sucks when there is a lazy susan in the middle of the table and less considerate dinner partners will spin your food away from you. Qian W's review is totally accurate re: the way they ""served"" the dishes. These guys may secretly be cornhole champs. Most impressive was that when clearing baskets to make room, and there was one dumpling left, they grabbed the tongs, speared the poor dumpling, and hurled crudely it into another basket - all without tearing the skin of the dumpling.

"This is my second time here. Overall not as good as my experience 3 years ago (food was better) but still a good dinner spot to go to with friends, and not crazy overpriced. Good for dates as long as you get seated upstairs. Downstairs is super loud. Bacon wrapped olives were great, fried goat cheese pretty good (as any version of fried cheese balls usually is), paella and Brussels sprouts amazing, scallops pretty good, lamb meatballs disappointing. The almond cake was to die for. Sangria was ok. Red better than the white. I didn't love how they tried to seat us as at a table right in front of the entry way or why there was a table there to begin with, but I guess utilizing every inch of space and squeezing in as many tables as possible is typical for many nyc restaurants.

"Maybe it is all the hype and maybe my expectations were out of alignment but I felt seriously let down by dinner at Applewood. The service was very good and the decor, very inviting. The wine list was good and we were very pleased with both the selection and with our choice. Unfortunately when it comes to the food, we found the appetizers to be pretty bland and lacking in any imagination, taste or lasting impression. The entrees were equally bland and boring. The food quality is high but I can go to the market, purchase high quality product and heat it up with no effort. The prices at Applewood are definitely on the more expensive side, especially for Brooklyn, so I'd like a little more imaginative flavor and taste for my money.

"For a restaurant in a very tourist-heavy location, this place is great. I had some family staying at a hotel nearby so I wanted to find a restaurant that was close and not too adventurous. Enter Basso 56. Their scallop appetizer was great and perfectly cooked. The daily special, the seafood risotto, was amazing and creamy. The other daily special, the homemade pappardelle with duck breast, was also good; however, less memorable. For dessert, I got a huge portion of creme brle. I was skeptical about ordering a French dessert in an Italian restaurant but it was sooo good with a nice touch of citrus. The only complaint my family had was over the quality of the sangria (they felt it had too much ice and therefore was watered down).

"4 stars for food 2 stars for service We went here for lunch on a weekday holiday and it was pretty packed. Even though they don't serve the brunch menu on weekdays, a few of their regular lunch menu items were fairly brunchy. As such, we were able to order omlettes (egg white, goat cheese, and spinach; and mushrooms with sundried tomatoes). They were both pretty good. My companion also ordered a breakfast cocktail with pomegranite juice in it - that was a great drink. The service, however, was problematic. We asked for a side of french fries which never came and it was near impossible to get the attention of anyone in the wait staff.

"Had the pleasure of dining at this restaurant 3/8/2014. When the hostess called us to be seated for our 9:30p reservation, we didn't even realize it was 9:50. We were told our bar tab was being taken care of by the owner, who came over to graciously apologize for seating us so late. And, two tapas were sent over to our table as well. As we never complained, this is a great example of a man with pride in ownership, and fully aware of everything going on in a very busy restaurant. As for the food and ambiance, both excellent. Attentive service. Charcutero, croquettes, Pork special with tasty, juicy meat and crispy skin...all fantastic, will definitely return!",4,Had the pleasure of dining at this restaurant 382014 When the hostess called us to be seated for our 930p reservation we didnt even realize it was 950 We were told our bar tab was being taken care of by the owner who came over to graciously apologize for seating us so late And two tapas were sent over to our table as well As we never complained this is a great example of a man with pride in ownership and fully aware of everything going on in a very busy restaurant As for the food and ambiance both excellent Attentive service Charcutero croquettes Pork special with tasty juicy meat and crispy skinall fantastic will definitely return,0
"Let me tell you a story.... My softball team was sponsored by the angel that heaven let run a dive bar, Jeff. Last weekend we lost in the championship game 7-5. Hearts broken, 12 men and women (and a few fans) traveled from the upper east side to come break the news to our beloved sponsor that we had come up short on delivering a promised trophy for behind the homely bar. Within seconds of walking into the bar, down-trodden, Jeff exclaimed ""Next season I'll make it $1,000!"" Second place was about to feel a heck of a lot better than first. From that point on there were non stop buckets of delicious, ice cold Amstel Light, and shots of fireball and Jameson every 15 minutes like clockwork. Free range to fill the Jukebox with Billy Joel, Garth Brooks, Mark Morrison and every thing needed to re-lift spirits. Right about the time when we were starting to feel the effects of the 4th or 5th shot, dear, sweet, little Mama delivered basket upon basket of home cooked heaven. Buffalo wings? Sure mama batters and deep fries them herself. Oh you're a vegetarian? How would you like some mozzarella sticks? Wait, whats that? We're out of mozzarella sticks? Well Mama has some provolone and a whole lotta time. Are deep fried provolone sticks a thing? Yes Please! Oh so you ordered a burger huh? Did you appreciate the onions inside the meat? Cause I sure did. Food was on point and had the special touch that only Mama could bring. Now that dinner had been served, and a magical white castle crave case was somehow pulled from behind the bar, the normal 15 minute shots were back in play. After the ""Friends In Low Places"" sing-a-long wrapped up it was time to celebrate our second place finish in style. 2 ice cold bottles of Andre's finest champagne were promptly opened and sprayed all over the bar as if we were the New York Yankees celebrating our 27th World Series Championship. (Disclaimer: they wear goggles because champagne stings the eyes, a lot!) We came into that bar that night losers, and we left champions. Enough nice things cannot be said about Jeff and his Mama. They absolutely treat you like family. I think when people think of a world without racism and people who don't see colors or ethnicities they must be talking about Jeff, he'll get anyone drunk no matter their race and he'll be right there with you shot for shot.

"This would be five stars, except for the actual length of the meal. We didn't make a res anywhere last night, but wanted to go out. Tried the normal North Shore staples, but waits were all over an hour. Saw this menu a few weeks ago online, and decided to give it a go. Called over and was told the wait would be a half hour, and we could put our name in. Got there, and ended up at the bar to wait a bit. The staff was very friendly, even when being told it would be an extra 30-40 minutes to be seated. We ordered food at the bar, and once a table opened up, we were seated. All in all it took about an hour and ten to sit. The host told is dessert was on the house, and the bartender told us a drink was on her. Very cool way to handle the situation. Now, the reason for four stars was the food. I had the ribeye, wife had a gnocchi special. She loved the gnocchi, while I clean plated the steak. It was the best steak I've had on the Island in years. The quality of meat allowed me to eat each morsel of my bone-in, which is really uncommon. The live music was nice, the decor appealing. Some stuff seems out of place on the wall, but I get what they're aiming to do. Will give Gatsby another shot, and hopefully the service is quicker. When they moved us to the table, the restaurant kept the bartender as our server, which is inherently flawed. To expect someone who's already slinging drinks in a busy restaurant to be a server too, is unfair to them. She was really nice, and we tipped really well. Food is top notch. The alcohol selection should be better if they're offering it as a cocktail bar; I'm a snob, I know. Yes, I correctly used a semicolon in a Yelp review. Get some. So, the meal took about 2 1/2-3 hours including time at the bar. It's not often food quality will justify that wait.",4,This would be five stars except for the actual length of the meal We didnt make a res anywhere last night but wanted to go out Tried the normal North Shore staples but waits were all over an hour Saw this menu a few weeks ago online and decided to give it a go Called over and was told the wait would be a half hour and we could put our name in Got there and ended up at the bar to wait a bit The staff was very friendly even when being told it would be an extra 3040 minutes to be seated We ordered food at the bar and once a table opened up we were seated All in all it took about an hour and ten to sit The host told is dessert was on the house and the bartender told us a drink was on her Very cool way to handle the situation Now the reason for four stars was the food I had the ribeye wife had a gnocchi special She loved the gnocchi while I clean plated the steak It was the best steak Ive had on the Island in years The quality of meat allowed me to eat each morsel of my bonein which is really uncommon The live music was nice the decor appealing Some stuff seems out of place on the wall but I get what theyre aiming to do Will give Gatsby another shot and hopefully the service is quicker When they moved us to the table the restaurant kept the bartender as our server which is inherently flawed To expect someone whos already slinging drinks in a busy restaurant to be a server too is unfair to them She was really nice and we tipped really well Food is top notch The alcohol selection should be better if theyre offering it as a cocktail bar Im a snob I know Yes I correctly used a semicolon in a Yelp review Get some So the meal took about 2 123 hours including time at the bar Its not often food quality will justify that wait,0
"I bought it because the stainless steel would hold far fewer bacteria than a plastic turkey baster. However, this doesn't hold suction well. Liquid (wine in this case) doesn't just drip out... It RUNS out. I am able to work around it by quickly tilting it back to retain some liquid. I wanted to try to avoid using a glass thief as it would probably be broken by my clumsiness. I see there are plastic thiefs out.

"Hands down the best eats for soup dumplings! I've had their classic one which is the one without the crab; just pork! It's one of the best I've had, you know what.. it is the best! Best of all, it's inexpensive! I've been here since they opened the location on Mott. Their first location was the one on Elizabeth but throughout different change in owners, they somehow expanded and started this new one here a few years back! My friend comes here religiously on a weekly basis and yes the owner knows him and gives him a d/c or more food. It's great to travel with him to this place (not that you really need the discount, its pretty inexpensive here). I always have their shanghai pan fried noodles because it comes with a lot of noodles, sauce, meats and seafood! It's a mixture!! The pan friend noodles reminds me of eating with my parents in for dim sum because we always order a noodle after eating a few plates of dim sum!! I also tried their watercress dumplings... its INSANELY good! I have to say that they have outdone themselves with this one!

"Tried this place yesterday after attending the New York Hot Sauce Expo with some friends. We were in the mood to keep eating and didn't want to go far. Located on 27th and 7th it is a small restaurant that is comparable to Chipotle, but with Asian food. They have bowls, burgers, sushi and soup. I went for the Kobe beef burger with kobe beef, terriyaki onions, terriyaki ketchup , spicy mayo and japanese salad, lettuce, cucumber, carrot, cabbage, scallions, and kaiware. Ordered it with the tempura sweet potato fries. Everything came to about $14, but so worth it. I had the meal with terriyaki ketchup, wasabi mayo, spicy mayo and SRIRACHA! The whole meal was amazing. Another friend got the udon noodle soup with shrimp tempura which looked great and another got the shrimp tempura sushi roll which I tried and was delicious. Definitely wish I had this place closer to me, I would try everything on the menu.",4,Tried this place yesterday after attending the New York Hot Sauce Expo with some friends We were in the mood to keep eating and didnt want to go far Located on 27th and 7th it is a small restaurant that is comparable to Chipotle but with Asian food They have bowls burgers sushi and soup I went for the Kobe beef burger with kobe beef terriyaki onions terriyaki ketchup spicy mayo and japanese salad lettuce cucumber carrot cabbage scallions and kaiware Ordered it with the tempura sweet potato fries Everything came to about 14 but so worth it I had the meal with terriyaki ketchup wasabi mayo spicy mayo and SRIRACHA The whole meal was amazing Another friend got the udon noodle soup with shrimp tempura which looked great and another got the shrimp tempura sushi roll which I tried and was delicious Definitely wish I had this place closer to me I would try everything on the menu,0
"This has to be the best pizza experience in all of New York and not just because the pizza is the best in New York City, but because of the unique process that goes into making it. The pizza here is perfect, with a nice crunchy, thin and sweet crust and a tomato sauce that has no equal. It is some amazing stuff that the owner makes himself. But we'll get to that in a minute. The toppings are all mouth-watering and very fresh while the cheese is too good to be true, even if it looks a little different from your normal pizza. But this is no ordinary pizza. This is DiFara, where there is one guy making each and every pizza pie with the freshest ingredients possible, which he keeps in the back and are all imported from the motherland of italy. The process is long and arduous but in the end, you don't care as the pizza is just too tasty to make you upset. My dad and I finished a whole large plain pie. He usually doesn't eat that much pizza, so I was really impressed with it. Try to call beforehand and order fifteen to thirty minutes before getting there, because it takes the seventy-year-old owner that long to make the heavenly pies. The reason why is as follows: first, he kneads the dough and pours on the fresh tomato sauce made there. Next, he adds the mozzarella cheese off of a fresh slab of mozzarella, which looks pretty cool, as it isn't shaved but cut into quite lage pieces all over the pizza. Still covers the pizza very well and is all in all, a great way to do it. Then it goes in the oven and he continues. This is all without gloves and who cares about the health department because this place is just too good for them. His Igor-like assistant brings him any ingredients or toppings that he needs from the back and this goes on all day. When done, the pizza comes out with the cheese still bubbling and this is where it gets too good. He sprinkles fresh parmeasan cheese on the pie and then adds fresh basil by actually taking the plant and cutting it over the pie with a pair of scissors. Hey, he could be doing it with his hands, so the scissor is fine by me. Now, you wait for the pizza to cool and then, pizza bliss as you bite into it. This pizza really lived up to the hype and was a fantastic meal to leave new york for college. Last great taste of New York before heading down South. The place is a hole-in-the-wall type pizza parlor but it just can't be beat. Parking meters are around and the subway train is right by the pizza place, so getting there ain't the problem. It's the wait that upsets some, but just have some patience and you'll be feasting on what is the best pizza in new york and you'll have a great story for your pals.",5,This has to be the best pizza experience in all of New York and not just because the pizza is the best in New York City but because of the unique process that goes into making it The pizza here is perfect with a nice crunchy thin and sweet crust and a tomato sauce that has no equal It is some amazing stuff that the owner makes himself But well get to that in a minute The toppings are all mouthwatering and very fresh while the cheese is too good to be true even if it looks a little different from your normal pizza But this is no ordinary pizza This is DiFara where there is one guy making each and every pizza pie with the freshest ingredients possible which he keeps in the back and are all imported from the motherland of italy The process is long and arduous but in the end you dont care as the pizza is just too tasty to make you upset My dad and I finished a whole large plain pie He usually doesnt eat that much pizza so I was really impressed with it Try to call beforehand and order fifteen to thirty minutes before getting there because it takes the seventyyearold owner that long to make the heavenly pies The reason why is as follows first he kneads the dough and pours on the fresh tomato sauce made there Next he adds the mozzarella cheese off of a fresh slab of mozzarella which looks pretty cool as it isnt shaved but cut into quite lage pieces all over the pizza Still covers the pizza very well and is all in all a great way to do it Then it goes in the oven and he continues This is all without gloves and who cares about the health department because this place is just too good for them His Igorlike assistant brings him any ingredients or toppings that he needs from the back and this goes on all day When done the pizza comes out with the cheese still bubbling and this is where it gets too good He sprinkles fresh parmeasan cheese on the pie and then adds fresh basil by actually taking the plant and cutting it over the pie with a pair of scissors Hey he could be doing it with his hands so the scissor is fine by me Now you wait for the pizza to cool and then pizza bliss as you bite into it This pizza really lived up to the hype and was a fantastic meal to leave new york for college Last great taste of New York before heading down South The place is a holeinthewall type pizza parlor but it just cant be beat Parking meters are around and the subway train is right by the pizza place so getting there aint the problem Its the wait that upsets some but just have some patience and youll be feasting on what is the best pizza in new york and youll have a great story for your pals,0
"So our plan to go to Grimaldi's for dinner ended up happening much later in the day then we anticipated so we had to get a few pizza's to go because they were about to close. They made them fairly quickly - probably because they wanted to leave soon! :) Pizza was tasty. Liked the extra mozzerella on it, was surprised that the pepperoni was tiny. Would have liked to gotten there earlier because there were some other topping I would have tried but when exploring NYC the time gets away from you & dinner ends up being at almost 11 pm.

"I've been here a few times, and I have to give this place mixed reviews. The good: the dumplings are amazing. Wontons are also very good, although for some reason the waitress had a hard time understanding me when I ordered them and they take longer to come out. I accompanied some friends here once, and since I'd had dinner already, I just ordered wontons - only to find that for $3, I could get a huge bowl of them. In general, the prices here are fantastic. The bad: I'm not such a fan of their noodles. I thought the knife-cut noodles were sort of soggy, in an overcooked kind of way. The hand-pulled noodles were thin and not as chewy as I would have liked. Broth for the noodles is pretty good though. The fish balls are mediocre, although it's nice that they're the Fukinese kind (with meat in the middle). The ugly: never, ever am I going to order a ""house special"" in a Chinese restaurant again. I'm not sure what I was expecting, but I got the works - tripe, beef tendon, and all other sorts of innards that I wasn't particularly fond of. It's definitely my fault for not checking first, but let this be a warning that what may be special to a restaurant isn't necessarily what you want to order. Will I come back?

"I've been wanting to try this place for a while, and this memorial weekend, I finally did. At first I thought the wait would be insane because I saw so many people standing around, but it was actually only 20 minutes. The hostess even told us to not stay away for too long. Anyway, my friend and I shared one pizza with spinach and mushrooms. We also got the olives as a side. The olives were a bit too salty, so I couldn't have that many of them. The pizza, I really liked. It tasted really fresh especially with the herbs, which my friend identified as oregano. I also thought the spinach was yummy with a strong garlic flavor.",4,Ive been wanting to try this place for a while and this memorial weekend I finally did At first I thought the wait would be insane because I saw so many people standing around but it was actually only 20 minutes The hostess even told us to not stay away for too long Anyway my friend and I shared one pizza with spinach and mushrooms We also got the olives as a side The olives were a bit too salty so I couldnt have that many of them The pizza I really liked It tasted really fresh especially with the herbs which my friend identified as oregano I also thought the spinach was yummy with a strong garlic flavor,0

"I can't rave about this place enough. I kid you not, I found this place looking for a lobster lunch and after asking a few friends if they heard about it, their eyes just filled with glee. That was enough to to RSVP for lunch. The decor is wonderful and the place is immense. Do not take the large number of seating lightly as this place is well known to have a wait time. We were seated immediately in the well lit large wooden bench Victorian decorated dining room. Meal started with crab on toast, a dish that sounds simple but has wonderfully complex flavors. The lobsters as a main course comes deshelled with the middle split in half. Lightly charred to give the meat a bit of soft texture. Home made sodas kept us trying out new flavors during our meal. Caramel ice cream for desert was big enough for sharing. This was a real treat as the ice cream is served just at the right temp putting a large smile on my friends face at the end of the meal.

"After much acclaim, we decided to make an afternoon exploring Staten Island to visit Enoteca Maria. After a rain-soaked ferry ride, we walked a few blocks to this charming, homey spot located directly next to the old St. George Theatre. The food was exceptional, although a bit pricey and unfamiliar in some respects (I wanted to ask our waitress a few questions about the preparation and ingredients I was not familiar with, but she seemed rather annoyed by my inquiry and barely made eye contact through her glasses.) As a whole, service was attentive and prompt, but not especially welcoming as she seemed rather unfriendly. Our pasta with meat sauce was wonderful and made me wish I had grown up italian and been exposed to this every Sunday growing up, as was our assortment of cheeses. We played it rather safe, but we will be sure to venture out of our comfort zone a bit more in the future. The nonna huslting and bustling away in a kitchen even smaller than my own was quite the sight to see, and reminded me of my halles during the holidays. She too was a diminutive force of nature; seemingly tireless. I have read reviews about the music and atmosphere being too loud, but I disagree in this case.

I highly recommend the Tuscan Chianti (sorry...I don't remember the name, but I do remember the Tuscany connection). It was simply divine, and reasonably priced! We will definitely be back with friends.",3,After much acclaim we decided to make an afternoon exploring Staten Island to visit Enoteca Maria After a rainsoaked ferry ride we walked a few blocks to this charming homey spot located directly next to the old St George Theatre The food was exceptional although a bit pricey and unfamiliar in some respects I wanted to ask our waitress a few questions about the preparation and ingredients I was not familiar with but she seemed rather annoyed by my inquiry and barely made eye contact through her glasses As a whole service was attentive and prompt but not especially welcoming as she seemed rather unfriendly Our pasta with meat sauce was wonderful and made me wish I had grown up italian and been exposed to this every Sunday growing up as was our assortment of cheeses We played it rather safe but we will be sure to venture out of our comfort zone a bit more in the future The nonna huslting and bustling away in a kitchen even smaller than my own was quite the sight to see and reminded me of my halles during the holidays She too was a diminutive force of nature seemingly tireless I have read reviews about the music and atmosphere being too loud but I disagree in this case Dining here is an experience and the music small confines and the loud conversations in the exposed kitchen all add to the charm Its what makes Enoteca unique I highly recommend the Tuscan Chianti sorryI dont remember the name but I do remember the Tuscany connection It was simply divine and reasonably priced We will definitely be back with friends,0
"Sangrias are solid, although I think the base blanco and rojo are substantially better than the numerous variants. Pisco sour was watery, lacking in flavor, although the froth was good and the bartender did try to match my specs on how I like it. We ordered a number of appetizers, rather than mains. I found the yuca fries bland, even with ketchup. Lobster empanadas, the ceviches, and the corn cake with ropas viejas on it (I am blanking on its name) were all quite good. Three stars because unfortunately, for all that is competent, it is priced at Upper West side hotel restaurant prices, i.e., super-high. It just can't deliver the level of value needed to justify that price tag. They do get the extra star for the check-in offer, however, which eased our tab a lot.",4,Sangrias are solid although I think the base blanco and rojo are substantially better than the numerous variants Pisco sour was watery lacking in flavor although the froth was good and the bartender did try to match my specs on how I like it We ordered a number of appetizers rather than mains I found the yuca fries bland even with ketchup Lobster empanadas the ceviches and the corn cake with ropas viejas on it I am blanking on its name were all quite good Three stars because unfortunately for all that is competent it is priced at Upper West side hotel restaurant prices ie superhigh It just cant deliver the level of value needed to justify that price tag They do get the extra star for the checkin offer however which eased our tab a lot,0

"Came here for lunch with a group of 2 and we were immediately seated. No issues in getting a seat. For appetizer we ordered the popcorn alligator. I thought it would be interesting to try alligator meat but we were quite disappointed. The meat didn't taste ""gamey"" at all. It kind of tasted like popcorn chicken. They also served it with some chips at the base of the container which was not listed on the menu. I would have preferred to have more alligator meat than filling it up with chips. The creole mustard and grape jelly sauce that came with it was tasty and flavorful. It reminded me of sweet chili sauce. It was a little spicy but extremely mild. I wouldn't get this dish again. For the main courses, we ordered the jambalaya+3 eggs and banana foster french toast. I was disappointed with the jambalaya. The rice was not cooked properly, too soggy and it lacked flavor. Tasting only the rice without the eggs was very bland. The eggs helped a little, but not by much. The eggs were cooked to my friends' liking (well over easy). The ""sausages"" that was in the dish was also dry. It might be the meat they chose to use because there was little to no fat in it. As for the banana foster french toast, my friend thought it was too sweet. There was a lot of syrup on the plate. The bread was basically bathed in syrup (prob 3cm thick). The actual bananas on the toast was good. They were warm/cooked bananas, not sure how other people feel about it but I was okay with it. I just wish they had added more. The bread itself was fried and the combination of that and the type of bread they use, it was kind of chewy. It wasn't easy to cut the bread and the bread itself wasn't heavily soaked in egg. Inside the bread it was very tasteless as none of the flavors was able to seep through. In comparing the two, I definitely prefer the french toast over the jambalaya. I love the decor of the place. Lots of interesting things to look at. Service was excellent. The waitress was always filling up our water. I'll probably give this place another try and definitely try something else. But as of now, the food is just okay.",3,Came here for lunch with a group of 2 and we were immediately seated No issues in getting a seat For appetizer we ordered the popcorn alligator I thought it would be interesting to try alligator meat but we were quite disappointed The meat didnt taste gamey at all It kind of tasted like popcorn chicken They also served it with some chips at the base of the container which was not listed on the menu I would have preferred to have more alligator meat than filling it up with chips The creole mustard and grape jelly sauce that came with it was tasty and flavorful It reminded me of sweet chili sauce It was a little spicy but extremely mild I wouldnt get this dish again For the main courses we ordered the jambalaya3 eggs and banana foster french toast I was disappointed with the jambalaya The rice was not cooked properly too soggy and it lacked flavor Tasting only the rice without the eggs was very bland The eggs helped a little but not by much The eggs were cooked to my friends liking well over easy The sausages that was in the dish was also dry It might be the meat they chose to use because there was little to no fat in it As for the banana foster french toast my friend thought it was too sweet There was a lot of syrup on the plate The bread was basically bathed in syrup prob 3cm thick The actual bananas on the toast was good They were warmcooked bananas not sure how other people feel about it but I was okay with it I just wish they had added more The bread itself was fried and the combination of that and the type of bread they use it was kind of chewy It wasnt easy to cut the bread and the bread itself wasnt heavily soaked in egg Inside the bread it was very tasteless as none of the flavors was able to seep through In comparing the two I definitely prefer the french toast over the jambalaya I love the decor of the place Lots of interesting things to look at Service was excellent The waitress was always filling up our water Ill probably give this place another try and definitely try something else But as of now the food is just okay,0

"We were in NYC for vacation, and exhausted in Grand Central during rush hour. I checked Yelp to guide us to the best possible dinner. We were in the mood for either Italian or French, so my filtered search brought back Le Parisien. A subway ride and a short walk later we arrived, and were immediately seated in a window seat. We ordered the bistrot steak frites and marinieres mussels. We watched the rain begin the fall and relaxed from our long day in the city. Seated near us were a French couple, conversing in French, and carrying on their trip to this nice restaurant in Murray Hill.",4,We were in NYC for vacation and exhausted in Grand Central during rush hour I checked Yelp to guide us to the best possible dinner We were in the mood for either Italian or French so my filtered search brought back Le Parisien A subway ride and a short walk later we arrived and were immediately seated in a window seat We ordered the bistrot steak frites and marinieres mussels We watched the rain begin the fall and relaxed from our long day in the city Seated near us were a French couple conversing in French and carrying on their trip to this nice restaurant in Murray Hill,0
"This was very very good. The place is crowded but the food is spectacular. The French onion soup was the only part of the meal I thought was a bit lacking -- too much cheese so it was impossible to eat without a long string of cheese stretching inelegantly from your spoon/mouth to the bowl. Not a dish you want to eat on a date. And it was just bland, somehow--rubbery cheese without enough beef broth/onion taste. However, it was warm and comforting on such a blustery winter day. The butternut squash and ricotta agnolotti (available as either an appetizer or an entree for lunch) were AMAZING. They were swimming in butter and sprinkled with some herbs and pumpkin seeds, which added a crunch that contrasted with the soft, almost sweet filling. SO good. My friend had the roasted lamb sandwich, and the bite I had of it was also extremely good. There was a spicy mayonnaise or something within, along with pieces of lamb and some grilled zucchini (I think). The bread was very good, soft and not stale or crunchy. I only wish I'd had room for dessert...but alas, next time.",5,This was very very good The place is crowded but the food is spectacular The French onion soup was the only part of the meal I thought was a bit lacking too much cheese so it was impossible to eat without a long string of cheese stretching inelegantly from your spoonmouth to the bowl Not a dish you want to eat on a date And it was just bland somehowrubbery cheese without enough beef brothonion taste However it was warm and comforting on such a blustery winter day The butternut squash and ricotta agnolotti available as either an appetizer or an entree for lunch were AMAZING They were swimming in butter and sprinkled with some herbs and pumpkin seeds which added a crunch that contrasted with the soft almost sweet filling SO good My friend had the roasted lamb sandwich and the bite I had of it was also extremely good There was a spicy mayonnaise or something within along with pieces of lamb and some grilled zucchini I think The bread was very good soft and not stale or crunchy I only wish Id had room for dessertbut alas next time,0
"We were looking for something away from the tourist trap crap and happened upon empanada mama. So far the best meal we have had while visiting here. My wife and I sampled many different empanadas, plantain chips, and quacamole. Delicious. Everything was fantastic. We didn't care much for the Greek spinach and feta, it wasn't bad, just didn't seem to fit well. The sauces that came with the empanadas were incredible especially the green sauce. It was very crowded and not much seating but we were seated right away at 11:00 pm.

"The NY foodie 'blog-o-sphere' is a fascinating creature. Thanks to the buzz generated from such sites as Serious Eats, Eater, Chowhound, etc, this tiny little hole in the wall noodle joint has been escalated to celebrity status. I imagine that the recent influx of Caucasian hipster kids sporting $1000 SLR cams, streaming through the doors and shoving their 100mm f/2.8 macro lenses into $4.50 bowls of soup, must provide a constant source of amusement to the owners of this place. My visit to Lan Zhou was not premeditated. Rather, I had gotten lost on my way to meet some friends at White Star, and upon seeing the signage of this hype machine, decided that I must see what this buzz is all about. It's mesmerizing to watch the noodle puller hard at work at his trade. A beige ball of dough is transformed effortlessly into gossamer ribbons of carb-y goodness. My fellow diners were equally mesmerized, as there were no less than 3 other amateur food pornographers in the dining room, snapping away lustily with their cameras. For $4.50, the beef noodle soup is good, but lacks the depth of flavor and complexity of a good bowl of pho. A generous dose of chili oil and vinegar were needed, though in this case, I couldn't bring myself to use the condiments... they had been left out in an open container. My palate pleaded for the flavor boost, but I just couldn't and wouldn't risk a bout of food poisoning. The famous hand pulled noodles were quite soft, though not mushy, and offered just a slight bit of resistance when chewed. A few slabs of greasy, overcooked, and gristle-y beef completed the dish. As others have noted, the dining area is sparse, dirty, cramped, and with about as much ambiance as a prison shower. A vermin sighting would not have been out of place (there was none thankfully). The food and prices are in-line with the benchmark that the rest of Chinatown has set, so aside from the noodle pulling show, there's little reason to visit.",2,The NY foodie blogosphere is a fascinating creature Thanks to the buzz generated from such sites as Serious Eats Eater Chowhound etc this tiny little hole in the wall noodle joint has been escalated to celebrity status I imagine that the recent influx of Caucasian hipster kids sporting 1000 SLR cams streaming through the doors and shoving their 100mm f28 macro lenses into 450 bowls of soup must provide a constant source of amusement to the owners of this place My visit to Lan Zhou was not premeditated Rather I had gotten lost on my way to meet some friends at White Star and upon seeing the signage of this hype machine decided that I must see what this buzz is all about Its mesmerizing to watch the noodle puller hard at work at his trade A beige ball of dough is transformed effortlessly into gossamer ribbons of carby goodness My fellow diners were equally mesmerized as there were no less than 3 other amateur food pornographers in the dining room snapping away lustily with their cameras For 450 the beef noodle soup is good but lacks the depth of flavor and complexity of a good bowl of pho A generous dose of chili oil and vinegar were needed though in this case I couldnt bring myself to use the condiments they had been left out in an open container My palate pleaded for the flavor boost but I just couldnt and wouldnt risk a bout of food poisoning The famous hand pulled noodles were quite soft though not mushy and offered just a slight bit of resistance when chewed A few slabs of greasy overcooked and gristley beef completed the dish As others have noted the dining area is sparse dirty cramped and with about as much ambiance as a prison shower A vermin sighting would not have been out of place there was none thankfully The food and prices are inline with the benchmark that the rest of Chinatown has set so aside from the noodle pulling show theres little reason to visit,0
"Went in with high hopes on a ten burger tour of the city and was shocked by how bad it was. By far the worst burger of the day, and definitely one of the top five worst burgers I've ever had (only counting real burgers here - not fast food/airport/hospital burgers). The meat was dry as sawdust, it was overcooked, the cheese was not remotely melted, and it seemed as if the kitchen forgot to buy salt and pepper this week because there wasn't the faintest hint of seasoning.

"The quality of the food is the best. I love the mushroom burger and fries. The green spinach salad is really healthy and I've never had cream of mushroom soup like I had at Janes. Even the bread that they serve is delicious. But what I REALLY came here for, was the dessert-the Choco Chip cookies dipped in whole milk and French bean vanilla ice cream. The cookies are baked and served fresh out the oven, so the contrast of warm cookies and ice cold milk/ice cream is to die for. I've been here for brunch as well. The eggs benedict is terrific, however for the price and for the long wait, there are so many other place located in the east village that are just as good at half the price.",5,The quality of the food is the best I love the mushroom burger and fries The green spinach salad is really healthy and Ive never had cream of mushroom soup like I had at Janes Even the bread that they serve is delicious But what I REALLY came here for was the dessertthe Choco Chip cookies dipped in whole milk and French bean vanilla ice cream The cookies are baked and served fresh out the oven so the contrast of warm cookies and ice cold milkice cream is to die for Ive been here for brunch as well The eggs benedict is terrific however for the price and for the long wait there are so many other place located in the east village that are just as good at half the price,0

Very filling, and the meat had a good blend of spices. - Order the empanadas. Perfection. But it was super loud, even downstairs; hard to hold a conversation without kind of yelling a bit. Kept wanting to ask them if they could turn down the music. I really don't understand restaurants that blast the music crazy loud - I mean what's the point? Still, definitely worth revisiting.

"After reading the rave reviews about this cart I decided to check it out on a saturday afternoon. When I got there I wasn't sure which cart to go to. There was one both sides of 6th ave. One seemed to have a line and the other did not. The one that had a line, the guy wasn't wearing the signature yellow t-shirt so I walked across the street to the other cart and saw the guy with the yellow t-shirt. Strangely there was no line at all. Was I at the right cart? Since I wanted to see what all the hoopla was about I got a chicken platter. For 5 bucks, the chicken platter comes with halal chicken, yellow rice, and salad drizzled on top with optional white sauce and hot sauce. The hot sauce is pretty damn hot so don't get too much. The chicken didn't look very fresh since it was probably sitting there all day. The food overall was just ok. It was somewhat flavorful but the explosion of flavor I was expecting didn't happen.

"This is my second time in New York, and the city hasn't let down. My dining experience at The Strand Bistro was nothing short of fantastic. The service was friendly and attentive, but not overbearing. Plates were cleared in a timely manner and our server was incredibly knowledgeable. As for the food...oh my lord, the food. The melon and prosciutto, panko crusted Mac and cheese, and tuna tartare were all fantastic first courses, but what absolutely grabbed me was the chilled corn soup with tomato ice. The tomato ice was quite possibly one of the most amazing components of a dish I have ever had. When you come here, you HAVE to order it! For the main course we had the pork chop-it was cooked perfectly and incredibly juicy. Served with grilled peaches and sauted spinach-perfection! As for dessert, we literally tried everything. The show stopper is hands down the crepe cake. To be fair, I'm a crepe whore. I love anything with crepes. Light flavors and the perfect amount of sweetness. A great ending to a perfect night.

"I got to dine last night at this Institution for Italian food with some friends. Since they don't take reservations and you have to be a ""friend"" or really know someone, this was an offer I could not refuse. When I first drove up, the place looks like a very small corner establishment with only the name above the door. If you did not know what you were looking at, you would really have no clue it was a restaurant. You enter the place and it is small just like everyone says. There is a full bar on the right and the bartender, Nick, has been here for over 38 years. He was funny and friendly and full of funny stories. I knew I was going to have a fun night and I did. My friends arrived and we were escorted to our table. It seems to work that a very select group of friends have over the decades have reserved tables and unless you are with them or get permission to use their table, you are not sitting down for dinner. So if you get invited to dine here, you have to go and experience this place. The place filled up in about a half hour and stayed that way thru the night. We had such a great time laughing and talking. This is the magic of this place, everyone ends up talking with each other and it becomes like a family event. One large group worked their way outside in front of the place and was playing the guitar and singing! Kind of a magical place. The food is served family style and the servers are very nice. There is no menus and your server will sit with you and go over what is being prepared tonight. We got some calamari, fried mozzarella, and fried soft shell crabs to start. All very tasty. The bartender came over and recited the available wines. We took his suggestion and enjoyed numerous bottles.

"If you keep on coming here like I do, then you'll sound like a broken/scratched record. Whether you sit in the main dining room, bar, front/side tables, or communal table, you'll have an excellent time, especially if you trust the sommelier. Ordered the pig skins and pig tails as appetizers, cavatelli with morel mushrooms to share, and cod and whole roasted rabbit for entrees. Everything was delicious. The pig skins were not just uber crispy, but also quite fresh and porky in scent and taste. Pig tails were nicely fried (not greasy) with good meat. The cavatelli was phe-nom-en-al! Oh so nice and chewy pasta with earthy yummy morel mushrooms. What a dish! The tasty cod was super flaky, fresh and light. The perfectly seasoned rabbit was delicious, tender, and flavorful. For drinks, we started with glasses of champagne (for our appetizers). After that, I asked the som, ""What bottle will be memorable with our non-app dishes?"" and then ordered the bottle below at his suggestion.

"My fianc and I wanted to host an engagement party lunch here. I came in and spoke to the event coordinator, Corina, about making the reservation. The party was for 20 people and after discussing what food would be included I was given an estimate of the price, which I found satisfactory after another phone call and a confirmation the next day. A week before the party, we came in to sign the contract. While the total price of the contract was the same, we noticed that based on the number of appetizers and main courses the cost should have been at about 53% of what they quoted. When we inquired what was the other 47% of the cost ""sneaked"" into the food category, Corina explained that they charged 47 percent of the cost of food to reserve the table, to move the table and to clean up after we left - ""space fee"". This information was not even mentioned during the initial visit and the following phone conversation. On top of that they charged 25% Gratuity. We were puzzled about the ""sneaked"" in ""space fee"" because every restaurant moves tables if the large party comes in and they clean tables and they don't charge any fees for moving and cleaning. Furthermore, when we asked if they would charge such a fee if 20 people just showed up she said that they would not, but that there would be no guarantee that the tables would be available. Meanwhile, when we were there at about 7PM on a Saturday night - supposedly busiest time for such business- the restaurant barely had 10 customers while they claim on the sign by the bar that the max occupancy is 300 people! So the restaurant was not even 5 percent full! In a conclusion, they would not waive this crazy fee so we left. In 2 days I called them out of courtesy and explained why we did not want to use their establishment and they really didn't care, it was as if our business never mattered. The good news is that The Bahche is located in an area with a ton of other choices. We walked down 5th Ave into Park Slope and within an hour we already had another venue booked where the food was heavenly and they didn't charge us a dime extra. In fact, we saved more than $300. During our search we asked in several establishments about a concept of the ""space fee"" and all of them said that they don't charge such ridiculous fees. So, I guess we should thank the Bahche for being greedy, sneaky and unprofessional so we could fully enjoy a once in a lifetime experience in another establishment that deserved our business just a few blocks away.",1,My fianc and I wanted to host an engagement party lunch here I came in and spoke to the event coordinator Corina about making the reservation The party was for 20 people and after discussing what food would be included I was given an estimate of the price which I found satisfactory after another phone call and a confirmation the next day A week before the party we came in to sign the contract While the total price of the contract was the same we noticed that based on the number of appetizers and main courses the cost should have been at about 53 of what they quoted When we inquired what was the other 47 of the cost sneaked into the food category Corina explained that they charged 47 percent of the cost of food to reserve the table to move the table and to clean up after we left space fee This information was not even mentioned during the initial visit and the following phone conversation On top of that they charged 25 Gratuity We were puzzled about the sneaked in space fee because every restaurant moves tables if the large party comes in and they clean tables and they dont charge any fees for moving and cleaning Furthermore when we asked if they would charge such a fee if 20 people just showed up she said that they would not but that there would be no guarantee that the tables would be available Meanwhile when we were there at about 7PM on a Saturday night supposedly busiest time for such business the restaurant barely had 10 customers while they claim on the sign by the bar that the max occupancy is 300 people So the restaurant was not even 5 percent full In a conclusion they would not waive this crazy fee so we left In 2 days I called them out of courtesy and explained why we did not want to use their establishment and they really didnt care it was as if our business never mattered The good news is that The Bahche is located in an area with a ton of other choices We walked down 5th Ave into Park Slope and within an hour we already had another venue booked where the food was heavenly and they didnt charge us a dime extra In fact we saved more than 300 During our search we asked in several establishments about a concept of the space fee and all of them said that they dont charge such ridiculous fees So I guess we should thank the Bahche for being greedy sneaky and unprofessional so we could fully enjoy a once in a lifetime experience in another establishment that deserved our business just a few blocks away,0

They came with a yummy green sauce. -- 2 empanadas each. They're really small, like hot pockets. I actually thought these were a little too fried. The outside was too crispy/greasy. I got spicy chicken....it had almost an Indian type taste. Also got TJC (Tuna Jalapeno Cheese)...very good, although the tuna may have been from a can. -- A medium pitcher of white sangria.

"Talking to my sis on the phone, I walked circles around this sandwich place on 12th that I had only discovered weeks earlier. The choice was down to two: Spanish Mackerel or Pork Belly. When our conversation was finally done and she was off to trade the apparent use of my skateboard for a free lunch (haha, my kind of promo). She warned me not to get the empty calories of a Boylan soda, but I wasn't about to listen unless a better choice popped up. And it did, sort of, the metro-sexual couple in front of me began discussing a blood orange lemonade and taping secretary girls dancing on tables, etc. Being a fan of lemonade, I had to try it. When I got to the front of the line, the young cashier guy gave me the stare down like he does all his patrons, he's kind of creepy, I assume its like a game of cat and mouse. I smiled with a short greeting and asked him about the two sandwich options that I was interested in. ""The mackerel is fishy and the pork belly is fatty."" I wanted to say 'No Duh!' but conflict never got a sandwich made faster or has never made my day happier (even when I was a MMA state champion =P). Plus I look a lil yuppie-ish today, so I shouldn't taint the name of hot yuppies everywhere. So 5 spice pork belly with pickled radishes (or was it radish-pickled) sandwich and a blood orange lemonade. The cashier asked if I wanted a corn on the cob, but I refused and kindly noted it for my next visit. I climbed the spiral staircase to check out the seating situation of the place and its pretty cozy with a small platform table running around the perimeter of the room and corresponding chairs. I went back down to grab my order, brought it to campus with me to enjoy. The sandwich is very similar to banh mi with the trimmings, but a large piece of braised pork belly sat in the middle (its cheap stuff but so delicious). One fatty bite and I was a fan, the sandwich rocks! It gets a little messy so make sure to grab some extra napkins. The mayo and radish juices get everywhere. The lemonade was a bit tart so after a few sips, I watered it down with my water bottle. I will definitely be back for more sandwiches and some cob. Price for the meal: $10.95.

"It is 3.5 but I tend to leave it as 3 stars. Frankly, I was a bit disappointed. Prob because I had a high expectation based on the chef's background -EMP vet and Mike C's review. And probably because I picked the wrong seat - at the bar as I usually did when dinning alone: since the restaurant is small the kitchen entrance was right in front of me so the whole night I was watching people running around. Not what I expected while I want a peaceful dinner. I stop whining here, onto the food. Overall is good with space to improve. I got the watermelon salad with ricotta and crispy farros to start, which was one of the most creative dish of that night. The watermelon was, well, as watermelon should be - juicy, sweet and fresh, and perfectly balanced with the creamy ricotta and crunchy farro. Only small complaint, the chunk was too big that I had to cut it into 4 smaller squares. Not a deal breaker. I could not finish as I was saving space for the two small dish - softshell crab and octopus. The softshell crab looked lovely until I start cutting it - the batter was too thick and too crisp that I could not taste the crab at all. The burrata, as a side of the dish, however, was the highlight. I had better softshell crab else where. Charred octopus with pork xo, brown butter foam. This dish was well executed. The pork xo (I think is some sort fried beacon crumb) was slightly crunchy and very savory. The brown butter, rich and buttery. Good, but not good enough to draw me back on its own. Dessert, yeah they just added to the menu, was sundae with yuzu peel, berries. Honestly, passable. I do like the decor, especially the Edison light bulbs hanging in the dinning room. The vibe is typical alphabet city type, lively, eclectic. Service was attentive though felt lukewarm at times. One thing I want to call out, they did not recommend me to switch wine after the salad, though a good manager should know the food coming the table did not go well with the first wine I ordered. It was myself told them that I needed to switch wine. I am not trying to pick on anyone but a good restaurant should know that. Being new is not an excuse. All in all, was a fine. Since I have not tried any entree, I think I will give it a second try in the next month or two. PS it is small so make a reservation.",3,It is 35 but I tend to leave it as 3 stars Frankly I was a bit disappointed Prob because I had a high expectation based on the chefs background EMP vet and Mike Cs review And probably because I picked the wrong seat at the bar as I usually did when dinning alone since the restaurant is small the kitchen entrance was right in front of me so the whole night I was watching people running around Not what I expected while I want a peaceful dinner I stop whining here onto the food Overall is good with space to improve I got the watermelon salad with ricotta and crispy farros to start which was one of the most creative dish of that night The watermelon was well as watermelon should be juicy sweet and fresh and perfectly balanced with the creamy ricotta and crunchy farro Only small complaint the chunk was too big that I had to cut it into 4 smaller squares Not a deal breaker I could not finish as I was saving space for the two small dish softshell crab and octopus The softshell crab looked lovely until I start cutting it the batter was too thick and too crisp that I could not taste the crab at all The burrata as a side of the dish however was the highlight I had better softshell crab else where Charred octopus with pork xo brown butter foam This dish was well executed The pork xo I think is some sort fried beacon crumb was slightly crunchy and very savory The brown butter rich and buttery Good but not good enough to draw me back on its own Dessert yeah they just added to the menu was sundae with yuzu peel berries Honestly passable I do like the decor especially the Edison light bulbs hanging in the dinning room The vibe is typical alphabet city type lively eclectic Service was attentive though felt lukewarm at times One thing I want to call out they did not recommend me to switch wine after the salad though a good manager should know the food coming the table did not go well with the first wine I ordered It was myself told them that I needed to switch wine I am not trying to pick on anyone but a good restaurant should know that Being new is not an excuse All in all was a fine Since I have not tried any entree I think I will give it a second try in the next month or two PS it is small so make a reservation,0
"Pretty place. Wine isn't inexpensive but a $36 bottle was just fine. The bread is delicious. The waiter was MIA after he poured the water. The suckling pig was just ok. It serves 2.5 people for $85. We ordered brussel sprouts to supplement which were good. The artichokes were uninteresting; the cuttlefish was very tasty but a small portion; the fennel salad portion was a joke. For $200 without dessert or coffee, you can do better.",2,Pretty place Wine isnt inexpensive but a 36 bottle was just fine The bread is delicious The waiter was MIA after he poured the water The suckling pig was just ok It serves 25 people for 85 We ordered brussel sprouts to supplement which were good The artichokes were uninteresting the cuttlefish was very tasty but a small portion the fennel salad portion was a joke For 200 without dessert or coffee you can do better,0

"Pretty good place for girls night dinner. Relatively empty at 7:30, but by 8:30 it was quite full. You can either choose to get tapas or racion (a normal portion). It was recommended you get 2-3 tapas a person. I think it would even be safe to go with 3 tapas a person even. Nothing ""wowed"" me, they were all decent enough dishes though. One dish I would recommend skipping would be the escargot. Never knew escargot could be bland, but it was here. Definitely order sangria. Not sure if it is every night, or just Wednesdays, but it was $20 a pitcher. $16 for half a pitcher. You do the math. Strongly recommend the blue pomegranite champagne one and strongly do NOT recommend the mango one. Service was really good. Our waitress checked up on us quite a few times and walked into numerous heated debates about inappropriate subjects that we should not be having in a restaurant...but at least she cared!",3,Pretty good place for girls night dinner Relatively empty at 730 but by 830 it was quite full You can either choose to get tapas or racion a normal portion It was recommended you get 23 tapas a person I think it would even be safe to go with 3 tapas a person even Nothing wowed me they were all decent enough dishes though One dish I would recommend skipping would be the escargot Never knew escargot could be bland but it was here Definitely order sangria Not sure if it is every night or just Wednesdays but it was 20 a pitcher 16 for half a pitcher You do the math Strongly recommend the blue pomegranite champagne one and strongly do NOT recommend the mango one Service was really good Our waitress checked up on us quite a few times and walked into numerous heated debates about inappropriate subjects that we should not be having in a restaurantbut at least she cared,0

"I've been eating at this restaurant for almost fifteen years. I'm only 28. As I grew older, I tried other things on the menu (the beef pan fried noodles with a couple of Tsingtaos hits the spot!), however, I've always ordered the Chicken over Rice with extra ginger. I've tried the combination spots nearby, tried the other restaurants, but they get it just right, every time. After a couple of years, they get to know what you eat, what you drink, like an old school restaurant, if you're a consistent customer. It isn't the Chez Pierre, but it's one of the best greasy spoons I've been to, and I'm glad it stood the test of time.

"Made it just in time before their closing! I wanted to pick up a parfait for late night snack with my expiring $5 paypal offer. Instead the workers offered me sandwiches and pastries to take home for free.

"This place has amazing fries, not matter what kind (skinny or steak) !! I usually order my lunch from here which usually consists of a specialty wrap with fries. Great thing is, its their lunch special so its about $7 for the combo plus a can of soda. Sweet deal. Tried their garlic and tomato pizza, too. AMAZING. What really prompted this review was their delivery. It is usually prompt, but they must have a new delivery guy who doesn't know much about Hoboken, so my order took longer than usual. And, when he called for directions to get here... we had the illest language barrier. Can't fault them for a poor delivery guy.

"Had a great meal here Friday night with a group of four. It got off to a rocky start with the hostess, however, who really should take some tips on working with customers from our very friendly, lovely waitress. That said, once we were seated, great experience. Started with the Dark and Stormy cocktail (x 2 - so good!) and some Pork Slap Beer. We started with the guacamole and taro chips, and the Tajadas (fried, sweet plantains. with aged cheese). Perfect. For arepas, we had La Mulata (vegetarian delight - spicy/salty, really terrific), Los Muchachos (rave reviews) and Pabelln Criollo platter (didn't get to try - it was inhaled. Always a good sign.).

"Me and the lady friend decided to come check out the lovely vegetarian delight that is The Queens Kickshaw. Despite nearly drowning in a sea of hipsters, the place is definitely one of my top picks if you find yourself or someone else in Astoria. First off, they have an impressive beer menu, including rotating specials on tap. It is a little crowded, but if you don't mind talking with strangers, then its no biggie. They do play a lot of good music, and usually play the whole album, which is refreshing especially when they are rocking that Queen. Now for what we had. The main and correct choice at this fine establishment is the plain old grilled cheese with tomato soup. Sweet baby Jesus it is a party in your mouth. You will want to make out with the bowl when you run out of soup, so make sure no one is looking when you do. The cheese is excellent and oh so ooey gooey, and is only improved by dipping in that sweet tomato-y mana from heaven. Also the lady friend lobbied for the queso, which was also very good. Being from Texas however, I'd give it a strong B. Our other side was the macaroni and cheese, which is very good, although not the best I've had in Astoria. Still a great side to enjoy when you are between bites of the aforementioned cheesy tomato-y goodness. DO NOT ORDER THE BREAD PUDDING. It is dry, and is much more bread than pudding. That cost them a star. Sorry dude, its just not good bread pudding. We can still be friends.

"SIX STARS!!! I WANT TO GIVE THIS 6 STARS!!!!! Holy damn. I cannot believe I'm writing a review for Rao's!!!!!!!!! You are all probably wondering how the hell I managed to get in, seeing that reservations are currently booked through 2011 (not that you can get one past that. It's really about who you know), and the only exceptions ever made for a table have been for Presidents!! And even then, those were extraordinary circumstances!! Well, let's just say working for a certain Food Network show featuring Bobby Flay throwing down against Rao's (with Rao's winning) certainly helped get our entire crew into the restaurant for the premiere of the episode!!! When the rumor first started flying around the office about the possibility of getting into Rao's, most of us shrugged it off as just that, a rumor. As time passed that rumor became a certainty! We eventually had scored at least the ability to come in and hang out at the bar, but were told that no way would be get a table. In fact, I'm pretty sure they laughed when we asked! So we all arrive and as predicted were crammed up against the bar for the screening of the episode. When I first entered, Frank Pellegrino came up and introduced himself TO ME!! As we all stood there I noticed a cast member or two from The Sopranos! After Frank silenced the entire restaurant to announce our entire team (whoa!!) we all watched the Feast of the 7 Fishes Throwdown! As the episode wound to an end, a rumor popped up that holy hell Rao's was going to seat and feed us. O.M.G!!!!!! That rumor proved true!! We were all seated and served fresh mozzarella, tomato and red peppers, clams, and a seafood salad for appetizers. I had everything that didn't involve seafood and my God was I in Heaven!! Not realizing that that was just the appetizer, our faces lit up with delight as they brought out the main course of pasta with marinara sauce and massive meatballs (ha ha)! These were probably some of the best meatballs I've ever had. Of course, my only frame of reference would be Ikea's. : ) Frank noticed we had finished our first bottle of champagne, and upon finding empty glasses unacceptable, snapped his fingers and made another bottle of bubbly appear! THEN he proceeded to serenade us with a performance of a song he wrote and sang back in the day. My God. People, this was like having Frank Sinatra give a private performance. Think getting that table is impressive? Try this. WE TOOK OVER THE WHOLE DAMNED PLACE!!!! They ended up clearing tables out of the way and making a dance floor!! Frank put on some tunes from the famous jukebox (I will Survive, We are Family, etc..) and all the ladies (and some of the gents) got up and tore up the proverbial rug with him! When all was said and done, and with delicious Italian food in our bellies, Frank thanked us all for such an amazing experience, which again further floored us, as it was US that had the amazing experience! We all went home to our beds to sleep, only to wake wondering if it was all a dream. But no, it happened. Thankfully there are pics to prove it! I wish I could say that I would be back at Rao's soon. Alas, that will most certainly not happen. This was TRULY a once in a lifetime experience. Then again, we never expected to even get in in the first place! So hey! You never know! ...no seriously, this won't ever happen again. : ) Thank You Frank and all of Rao's!

"This place is a hole in the wall, quite literally. Located on a quiet street, the store is recognizable due to the long line extending out of it's store. My mom and I ordered the Chives & Pork fried dumplings only. We see a lot of people ordering the sesame pancake but unfortunately, I wasn't able to try it this time. The dumplings were good. But wasn't amazing. Yes this place won't disappoint you. But then again, it didn't amaze me to the point where I would seek out this place for fried dumplings next time. The skin easily deattaches from the meat, which makes it rather annoying to eat because one would fall and I would have to pick it up with my fork again and then having the struggle of trying to keep the skin and meat on the fork while trying to stick the thing in your mouth without getting oil around your mouth. However, for $1 for 4 dumplings, you can't go wrong with the price. It's cheap, it's good, it's a no brainer. Great place to go to if you want a fast (minus the line) and cheap food option. Other than that, if you want to try this place out, go ahead. As for me, I'm alright. I've tried far too many fried dumplings that I can't point out which one is better.",4,This place is a hole in the wall quite literally Located on a quiet street the store is recognizable due to the long line extending out of its store My mom and I ordered the Chives Pork fried dumplings only We see a lot of people ordering the sesame pancake but unfortunately I wasnt able to try it this time The dumplings were good But wasnt amazing Yes this place wont disappoint you But then again it didnt amaze me to the point where I would seek out this place for fried dumplings next time The skin easily deattaches from the meat which makes it rather annoying to eat because one would fall and I would have to pick it up with my fork again and then having the struggle of trying to keep the skin and meat on the fork while trying to stick the thing in your mouth without getting oil around your mouth However for 1 for 4 dumplings you cant go wrong with the price Its cheap its good its a no brainer Great place to go to if you want a fast minus the line and cheap food option Other than that if you want to try this place out go ahead As for me Im alright Ive tried far too many fried dumplings that I cant point out which one is better,0
"I'm really surprised at the good ratings for this restaurant. This place is so well lit I can probably count the pores on my face in the mirror. Tables seemed dingy, service seemed slow...I never even received a glass of water. Ordered the Japanese style fried chicken, which was decent at most. It didn't taste like it was just made...in fact it had almost a chewiness to the skin, which of course should have been crispy. I was surprised they didnt even have Japanese pancake on the menu...however there was a pictured item called Okonomiyaki listed. I figured I'd order it anyway, it wouldnt hurt. BUT when we recieved the dish it was literally an omelette with some cr@p sauce inside. WTH? $8 for two scrambled eggs basically. BTW I ordered their green apple hi cocktail and it tasted like 95% sugar/sour mix and 5% vodka. My friends glass of wine was miniature, perfect for my 7lb dog I suppose. I ended up with Chicken donburi and my friend ordered Pork katsu. My entree was an epic failure, the egg being pretty much fully cooked, the chicken being dry and tasteless, no sauces, no flavor. The katsu didnt look or taste much better. What a ripoff.......NEVER AGAIN.

"Came here on a rainy Saturday and almost walked out because of the bright blue paint on the wall and cafeteria style presentation. But upon looking at the chalkboard full of Tunisian delicacies my stomach and gut told me to stay. Well more my stomach than my gut. I ordered the lamb kofta plate. The portions are massive so come here hungry! The plate includes the meat, rice and salad. The kofta was flavorful and light unlike most kofta I've had. Most kofta is greasy but here it is not. The rice is nice and light. The salad was mediocre at best but didn't taste bad so I continued eating it. I ordered a piece of baklava for desert which was so good I wanted to order another piece. Its very fresh, full of pistachios and just enough sweetness from the sugar syrup. Not too much syrup which destroys it. I had the baklava accompanied with their Arabic mint tea. SO good and highly recommended. For 4 bucks you get a huge teapot full of tea. Which filled 8 cups. The service here is awesome and friendly. The guys who work here are so kind and friendly. Always a good sign of good management. Keep up the good work guys! I would definitely come back here and try the falafel over hummus which looked amazing!

What a wonderful surprise! I have lived around corner and never noticed this hidden gem. I am now forever grateful to the birthday girl who introduced this restaurant to me. This is both a wonderful space for a large party or a romantic Friday night date. Our party of 12 sat a nicely sized round table on the second floor. The menu is quite extensive with an array of mouth watering dishes. I highly recommend the brussels sprouts. We ordered 4 servings and after gulping these down we were still contemplating if we should order a second round- DELICIOUS!! Alta is most certainly a new favorite for tapas.,5,What a wonderful surprise I have lived around corner and never noticed this hidden gem I am now forever grateful to the birthday girl who introduced this restaurant to me This is both a wonderful space for a large party or a romantic Friday night date Our party of 12 sat a nicely sized round table on the second floor The menu is quite extensive with an array of mouth watering dishes I highly recommend the brussels sprouts We ordered 4 servings and after gulping these down we were still contemplating if we should order a second round DELICIOUS Alta is most certainly a new favorite for tapas,0
"I came here in the midst of winter storm Hercules for some hot coffee and hearty food. I was not disappointed. The cafe is divided into two parts--there's a small communal table and some bar space up front and a few larger communal tables in the back. It's a great spot to hit up by yourself or with friends/a date. I ordered a pour-over of the Peruvian blend coffee. The menu features a fair selection of other coffees, all from different countries hitting a variety of notes depending on your mood. For food, I decided to keep it simple with the cheddar & mozzarella grilled cheese sandwich served with tomato soup. The tomato soup was out of this world--nicely textured and divinely flavored with hints of garlic and dill. The grilled cheese was served on buttery brioche, equal parts crunchy and gooey (in all the right places). Looking forward to checking out something on their Asian-fusion end of things (I'm thinking either the Kickshaw Bibimbap or the Kimchi Lasaga) next time I return. My one complaint for the Kickshaw: no wireless. If you bring work, make sure you don't need the internet.",4,I came here in the midst of winter storm Hercules for some hot coffee and hearty food I was not disappointed The cafe is divided into two partstheres a small communal table and some bar space up front and a few larger communal tables in the back Its a great spot to hit up by yourself or with friendsa date I ordered a pourover of the Peruvian blend coffee The menu features a fair selection of other coffees all from different countries hitting a variety of notes depending on your mood For food I decided to keep it simple with the cheddar mozzarella grilled cheese sandwich served with tomato soup The tomato soup was out of this worldnicely textured and divinely flavored with hints of garlic and dill The grilled cheese was served on buttery brioche equal parts crunchy and gooey in all the right places Looking forward to checking out something on their Asianfusion end of things Im thinking either the Kickshaw Bibimbap or the Kimchi Lasaga next time I return My one complaint for the Kickshaw no wireless If you bring work make sure you dont need the internet,0
"Yum yum yum yum. What we ordered: Fried chicken and waffles - The waffle was spectacular. Barely crispy outside and soft inside. The fried chicken was also so delicious. I ordered leg meat but for some reason got breast/wing and didn't even think about it until I had consumed one wing. The wings were fabulous. The breast was a little dry for my taste but skin was perfectly crunchy. Mix it all together with syrup and hot sauce and you have a winner. BBQ spare ribs - Yum! I'm not usually a wet sauce bbq kind of person cause it's usually too salty or too sweet or something but this was good. The meat was tender and well seasoned. Mac & Cheese - Eh. It was kind of cold. Have had better. My date really liked it though. I like my mac&cheese piping hot and smothery. Collard Greens - Pretty tasty. A little too salty for my palate. Corn bread (free starter when you sit down) - Eh. Kind of dry. So all in all, what I suggest is ordering things that are not premade (such as the sides) cause they prob have been sitting out. All of the freshly prepared food was delicious and making me want to go back right this second. As for the restaurant itself, I think it was nice enough. It was clean and our waitress was really nice. Went on a Wednesday night at like 9:45 and there was only one or two other tables there so we didn't have to wait. If the sides and cornbread were as good as everything else, I would have given this place 5 stars.",4,Yum yum yum yum What we ordered Fried chicken and waffles The waffle was spectacular Barely crispy outside and soft inside The fried chicken was also so delicious I ordered leg meat but for some reason got breastwing and didnt even think about it until I had consumed one wing The wings were fabulous The breast was a little dry for my taste but skin was perfectly crunchy Mix it all together with syrup and hot sauce and you have a winner BBQ spare ribs Yum Im not usually a wet sauce bbq kind of person cause its usually too salty or too sweet or something but this was good The meat was tender and well seasoned Mac Cheese Eh It was kind of cold Have had better My date really liked it though I like my maccheese piping hot and smothery Collard Greens Pretty tasty A little too salty for my palate Corn bread free starter when you sit down Eh Kind of dry So all in all what I suggest is ordering things that are not premade such as the sides cause they prob have been sitting out All of the freshly prepared food was delicious and making me want to go back right this second As for the restaurant itself I think it was nice enough It was clean and our waitress was really nice Went on a Wednesday night at like 945 and there was only one or two other tables there so we didnt have to wait If the sides and cornbread were as good as everything else I would have given this place 5 stars,0
Staff is friendly and the service is prompt once you are seated here. I typically go for their pork broth (I've been here twice and both times didn't see a reason to stray from the Akamaru Modern and added the egg). The chicken wing appetizer hit the spot as well. If you have a Ramen craving - you can't miss with this place. They lose a star for the long wait time in trying to get a table.,4,Staff is friendly and the service is prompt once you are seated here I typically go for their pork broth Ive been here twice and both times didnt see a reason to stray from the Akamaru Modern and added the egg The chicken wing appetizer hit the spot as well If you have a Ramen craving you cant miss with this place They lose a star for the long wait time in trying to get a table,0
"Great spot in soho - if your goin for dinner and its tough to get last minute reservations. Definitely get the Vodka pizza, I also had the Arugula (with cherry tomato/parmesan/balsamic) which was very good. Prices were reasonable. Smalls are around 15$ with 6 slices so its perfect for 2 people unless your really hungry.",4,Great spot in soho if your goin for dinner and its tough to get last minute reservations Definitely get the Vodka pizza I also had the Arugula with cherry tomatoparmesanbalsamic which was very good Prices were reasonable Smalls are around 15 with 6 slices so its perfect for 2 people unless your really hungry,0
"friendly, great wine list, pleasing space. really friendly I should say. they have a sister bar next door that does for beer what gag does for wine (against the grain it's called). the food is simple and good, the winelist favors small, interesting producers and the guys who run the place are just fantastically nice. good for private events (that's how I first discovered it).",5,friendly great wine list pleasing space really friendly I should say they have a sister bar next door that does for beer what gag does for wine against the grain its called the food is simple and good the winelist favors small interesting producers and the guys who run the place are just fantastically nice good for private events thats how I first discovered it,0
