"LOVE IT! The vent is a little wide, but I will keep that in mind when ordering. I bought this for a friend, and she is a very tall woman. She is very happy with it. It is very comfortable, and it is light weight. I am very pleased with the design. I have a large family, and the fact that it is a little heavier than I expected is great.",1

"I read the short story version of this book right after I finished ""The Blood & Bone Trilogy. I don't remember if I left a review but I do know I gave it 3 ***'s. What I do remember was how robbed/cheated I felt because the short story should have been so much more. I can't really explain how exited & pleased I was at received an email from the Author saying she changed her mind about Suicide "", the original title and making it into a three part trilogy. Let's just leave it at there may have been some singing, The Happy, Happy, Joy Joy song & the happy dance might've made a brief appearance. This third of the new trilogy is excellent!! :) The author took a mediocre, at best, short story & turns it into an incredible novel!! She superbly snakes around the existing material and proficiently pours powerful scenes into the narrative that grab your attention and not let it go. Also, I really like that she is keeping this trilogy in the same universe of "" The Blood & Bones Trabsolutely cake &It means we already have a basic working knowledge of the paranormal place & persons. There's no time wasted in big chunks of world &/or character building. I absolutely cannot wait for the next two booka.",0

"One of these days, I'm going to open up a new bag of cat food my cat doesn't like and it will get one star. That has to be, seeing as she gets herself in a tizzy over every new food I've ever given her. Iams Proactive Health is no exception. Never mind that she's far beyond being called a kitten. Yep.

So far there is a big difference now when I lay down to get some rest. The pests ( mites, or other pests) are not bothering me. I also treated my box spring with small amounts of pesticide to add additional protection. I recommend this product, it has lifted a tremendous burden off my shoulders and allowed me to sleep well at nights.",0

"This is a nice set, but the pieces are a bit thin. There is a tiny piece of cardboard that sits on the wall, but that is the only part of it that is truly worth it. It is a good value, but it is not very sturdy.The kids LOVE this toy. They have played with it for several years. They love the sounds and the music. It is very easy to use and the kids love it. They love the fact that it is made of wood. The kids will use it",1
"Has many pockets and a shoe holding pouch. Feels very well constructed. The mesh side pocket is great for putting my water bottles in without having them get my stuff all wet from condensation. As long as you don't buy this bag with the idea of storing too much in it, it's great. Seriously, the size is written in the description and it's just a little smaller than a medium bag but perfect for a set of clothes, shoes and a few extras.",0
"The first fountain lasted less than 1 month. The cheap plastic part just broke off in my hand when I was cleaning the system for only the 3rd time. The cats, and I, were loving it up until then. After all, it was the prettiest fountain out there, plus it is mostly ceramic. My poor boy loved drinking from it! I had concerns because of all the bad reviews but was optimistic that I would have a good experience. I returned the first one to Petsmart, which is where I purchased it and decided to take a try on another one ... some of us take longer to learn than others! That one started leaking all over the floor after cleaning it for the first time when I had it for little more than 1 week. Yes, the nut on the bottom was tightened. Same experience a number of other reviewers wrote about. The water was no longer coming up through the top end of the fountain, instead started coming out the bottom. I was so disgusted I just through it in the box and drove it back to Petsmart. I will try one of the cheap ones now and see if it works. At least if it breaks, I won't feel like I got taken for a ride. I paid over $80 for this piece of garbage! LISTEN TO THE BAD REVIEWS!!!",0

"I have been waiting for this book and it did not let me down! I read the entire thing in one day. I think this may be the best one yet, and I have read them all. ""Unseen"" brings all of the characters and story lines from all the previous series' together seamlessly. I don't want to give anything away about the ending, and you can read the description of the plot on the book jacket or Amazon, so I will just end with - get writing Ms. Slaughter! Can't wait for what is next!",0

"ok this unit arrived about 2 days after I ordered it, it was packaged very well, I was wanting the stainless steel version because I thought it would hold up much better, after I read a few things on the net I discovered that Copper actually dissipates heat better than stainless, so I got this AFTER I read copper has gone up about 40 percent lately and I didn't want to wait any longer. So far I soaked it in a vinegar solution with water to get all the goo off of it and plopped it down in the keg with boiling wart, this sanitized it, the wort was cooled to about 70 within 9 minutes this may be because I have well water and its very cold. If you are wanting to make beer on a regular basis and you have a large brew pot just get the 50 ft version, its only about 20 dollars more (at this time) and it will cool your wart that much faster and you can brew 5 gallons or 10 gallons. bottom line copper is getting freaking expensive, if you are going to get a wort chiller made of copper get it soon and get the most you can afford, don't wait today is march 4 and oil was at 105 so its just going to get more expensive and you can make cheep beer, so it will pay for its self the sooner you buy it and use it. as they say in the brew community, ""Cheers!""",0

"As a big fan of the early James Bond, I have tried to continue to enjoy the series of movies that followed the Sean Connery reign as Bond. These latter day movies with actors other than Connery (exception, Roger Moore) are just not satisfying to the older Bond fan. Judi Dench makes a very good ""M"" and Daniel Craig is almost believable as Bond. The story line is engaging. Waste your time on it if you cannot find any other movie that jumps out at you (to watch).",0

The adapter is in a large, multi-sided plastic bag with two large holes for the ethernet cable and a small pouch for the ethernet cable and ethernet adapter. It also has a small pouch for the ethernet cable and ethernet adapter. This adapter is very convenient for me to use for a long time. I use it with my ipad and wi-fi and it works great.

"This is my second read by K'wan and once again I was not disappointed! Kwan draws you in with his colorful characters and doesn't let you go until the last page. Street Dreams is about guy name Rio from the projects who starts off being just nickel and dime dealer from around the way, but when he's approached by Prince, the king of the streets..Rio's lifestyle quickly starts to change for the good for him. But when Prince's oldest son, Truck is released from prison all hell breaks loose out of jealousy. I instantly fell in love with Trinity(Rio's girlfriend), Shamel(his longtime childhood friend), Sally(his Mom) and Cutty(another one of his friends). Street Dreams is by far one of the BEST books I've read in a long time! K'wan keeps you on the edge of your seat chapter after chapter and snatches your breath away at the very end! Street Dreams is HIGHLY recommended for readers who love drama, suspense, action, love and edge of the seat writing all in one! (Hoodrat by him also comes HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!) Keep'em coming K'wan!!!",0

"I will say it up front, yes this was a film never previously seen in America, maybe it still has not been. It is from the 1970's, and just about outdoes most other genre entries (no pun intended) in terms of the degree of sleaze radiating off the screen. Another film where you could speed the film up 4-5 times and quite easily follow the plot, what little there is of it. I found it interesting to study the eyes of the people 'acting' in this film, there is a lot of uneasiness amid the sleaze on show. It is really a straight porn shoot (and it is without a doubt X-rated) with one or two lesbian scenes which would have been pretty radical for those days (I'm guessing). To give an indication of the story and plot standard, the short sex scenes which were often threatening to break out into a very laid back orgy, well those X-rated scenes were the actual highlight of the entire mess on show. It must have cost a fair bit to make, as it is well shot for the era, and whoever was behind the camera had at least some idea of what they were doing. I cannot comment on the dialogue as I couldn't bear to expose myself to it (it was dubbed anyway I think, which compounds the agony). And if you are thinking of purchasing this DVD based on the jacket featuring a gorilla obviously rather taken with a diverting buxom blonde, you will be sadly disappointed. There is a lame sex scene involving the bloke in the gorilla suit, with a young woman who obviously is unhappy, does not want her face caught on film, and raises the possibility whether she was aware of what was going on or even whether she felt under a little duress during that scene. Which brings me back to the central point, yes, this is sleaze with a capital 'S'; you sort of do get what was advertised, but it is so tame and takes itself seriously by today's 'standards' it is almost quaint.",0
"Melina and Gillian Lloyd are both caught up in the events of the book, and the reader learns a lot about them.

"I never read this kind of material, but once I picked it up I couldn't put it down. Not dry or boring in any way, Levitt has the reader looking at the world in ways never imagined.

Read the first chapter and see if you can put it down! I recommend it highly because it challenges your thinking.",0

"When I saw this DVD I thought it might be good with Penn directing and the cast, but now I can see why I do not recall seeing its trailer at a theatre or on my tv screen.... The dialogue is badly muddled some of the time.....e.g. when Frank and Joe are alone on the porch of their old farm and running around in the corn field......Another instance is when Joe goes to the bar to see why Frank is not at home where his child is being born. There is also a tendency to leave things hanging..... I found it a waste of some talented actors e.g. Bronson, Hopper, Denis and others, but admit that it is probably the best thing that Morse has ever done on the big screen...normally he walks thru his roles like a zombie. I found Mortensen's character, Frank, to be sad and compelling, but the others were fleeting in time and depth. Finally, are we to believe that after Frank beats the bartender to death, that his brother, a dedicated police officer, just sighs and tells us that he never saw him again? He is of course not aware of the other things he has done before he hit town but this is a problem that does not deserve a slap on the wrist and a sad farewell, no matter if he is his brother or not. That was the final straw for me.",0
The story was ok at best you really should edit! The words in this book that were misspelled and words that shouldn't been in the sentence.

"Received the item well packaged and very fast. Took about twenty minutes for assembly. All the necessary tools are provided. The assembly steps are more or less intuitive so hardly necessary to read the instructions. The construction is quite good. The machinery fit and finish are almost top notch, but at this price one can hardly complain. The bike works well, will see on durability, but so far very good. After three years, this still works like when it was new. Excellent Value! Four stars instead of five is largely due to screen, which is somewhat difficult to read. In this day and age of widely available LED readouts, one could have expected this to have a more readable lit screen, instead of LCD. Also, the mini fan is not very functional, but cute nonetheless. But I actually sometimes use the little fan feature as background noise so I can concentrate on my workout better. Overall, Schwinn did a very good quality job with this bike and as usual, Amazon delivers to us in the most efficient ways. Thanks.",0

"It appears that Arcos has skimped to make this a cheaper model. A MAJOR negative that the potential capacity is really a lot less than perceived. This is due to the inconceivable absence of ANY expansion via SDHC cards or any other flash cards. The greatly limits flexibility. It is always an important idea to leave a considerable amount of empty space on the locked up, internal flash of the unit, as performance several degrades, as the internal flash fills up. As it gets around 70%, besides the performance issues, sort issues, there is a much grater chance of database and OS, issues, because of the needing of large work areas, that are not available. Not allowing external expansion from SDHC, truly helps this situation. I guess this also forces Archos customers to HAVE to get propriatary Archos units and drives to expand at all. Skip this unit (however DON'T get a Ipod).",0
"What can I say? I'm a 5'6"" 40-something eventer with big horses and having a mounting block sure makes setting and resetting fences much easier. I used to have a three-step block and unfortunately, the friend to whom I loaned it managed to break it (yep, really!). So, missing my block, I ordered this one. At first, I missed having that top third step, but after a week or so, I got used to it. What I like: Stability. I have a youngster who is learning to stand still for mounting, and this block has a nice, wide base, so it doesn't move around easily. I can get on and off 20 times, holding a fidgety youngster, and this block never threatens to tip over. The steps themselves are plenty wide enough to allow for standing (not just stepping) on them. The handle is built into the front instead of the back, which makes the block easier to pick up. While substantial enough in weight, it's light enough to pick up and carry across the arena in one hand (while leading a horse with the other hand) without any real effort. What I don't like: I wish it were about 2"" taller. Also, the recessed area on the back side (not visible in the product photos on Amazon) will make a very attractive nesting location for yellowjackets - a better design would be a straight side all the way down the back. And finally, the steps are either slightly warped or designed to have a slight depression in the middle of each step. This means the mounting block collects water and must be tipped off before using after a rainstorm. I suspect this is a design element to enhance step stability, but the problem of water collection could be eliminated by drilling a small hole in the middle of the depression (I may do this myself).",0

I bought these way too lengthy but since they are excellent cables i don't mind. Will find a use for the 80ft i have left (haha). Get these with some banana plugs and you're good to go.,0
The suspense was awesome......characters made me laugh and cry and just know how they feel. I was just blown away by the way the author,1
Pros: Wash well Laundry bag included thicker than expected Great quality materials Cons: Too small for my petite frame I had to return it.,1
"This is not a professional grade yoga mat, but it's perfect for beginners. It seems like it would eventually start shredding after a lot of use, but still a very nice yoga mat.",0
"I am so pleased with the ODOR Absorbed Activated Charcoal NATURAL Deodorizer Bag by UBERPAKK. In the past the only option I thought I had was placing one of those charcoal tubs in my bathroom or closet which works pretty well but doesn't look nice at all. This will eliminate the odors and yet be non-imposing on my decor or be forgotten in my closet. I put one of these right smack dab on the top of the tank of my toilet of my guest bathroom which is only used when we have guests. It goes great in there and also looks very decorative. (So much better than having the charcoal tub sitting on the floor). I put the other one in a guest room closet. I really hate going in one of my rooms, opening up a closet and it smelling musty. Now, it never will. I hung it on a hanger and it can be seen by anyone who hangs their clothes in there. It just looks nice. The muted green goes with any room in my house so I am certain that I will be ordering more before too long. I was fortunate to receive this product at a discount in exchange for my HONEST & UNBIASED opinion. I ALWAYS pretest every product prior to writing a review. I am free to write whatever I believe to be true, whether positive or negative. This is my true story and my honest opinion.",0
"This kit comes with everything you need to polish metal. I took the guards and grinding wheels off an old 6"" grinder I had. I installed the buffing wheels and had the machine buffing parts in only a few minutes. It comes with roughing blocks for course, fine, and extra fine. I didn't notice a brown block since it looked like I got two grey blocks; not a big deal for me since the three grits do exactly what I need. If you are doing jewelry, then you need the extra fine that this kit provides, but the fine will be enough to finish most general polishing. Because there are three different grades of roughing blocks, the kit also comes with three different grades of buffing wheels. You need these to keep from mixing the grits of the roughing blocks onto the same wheels. The instruction manual is clear on how to use the kit and to get a good polish. It also shows which roughing grades to use on which metals. So far I have polished about 23 steel, brass, and iron parts with great results. I also buffed plastic parts; one of which were the plastic headlights on a car. This kit had them looking almost new. I am very happy with this kit and glad I didn't spend the money to buy the items separately. UPDATE: Its been 1.5 years since I started using this kit. I have used it so much that the wheels now need to be replaced and I need more roughing blocks. So, I just bought another one of these kits on sale since it was cheaper than buying all the parts separately. I have buffed so many things that I wonder how I ever got along without it before. I even cleaned up some of my wife's jewelry.",0
Works as advertise. I installed it in my N3dsXL and I have NOOOOO problems with all my over 200 games. Love it. Real value for my money.,0
"I've read (and enjoyed) so many of the Lord's books, but this one just doesn't hold my interest. I had to read it before I could get into the story, and it's just not my cup of tea. I'm glad I read it, because it gives me hope for the next installment in the series. I'd be remiss if I didn't give this one a 4. 5 stars.",1
"I have seen the first season. Now reading the first novel. It is reeling me in more and more. The descriptive nature of the writing is entrancing. The line from ""The Gathering"" about the bagpipers relating that the trilling of the chanters above the drones ""made the blood itch"" made me stop and read again and again. It is the finest description I have read. I feel my skin shivering at the thought.",0
Good for backpacking or when hiking. The only downside is that it's a little hard to put,1
"Breacher (Arnold Schwarzenegger) leads a group of people into a dangerous city in search of a serial killer. The group is led by a woman named Danielle (Amy Adams) who is a former prostitute. She is a little disturbed by the murder of her ex-boyfriend who has been accused of killing her. Danielle is a bit paranoid and has a very low opinion of the police. She also has a very high opinion of the police as they are on a high level. The story is pretty straight forward, but the acting is quite good. There is also a little bit of nudity in this film, but it is definitely not sexual. The storyline is not as dramatic as the previous films, but",1
these were for my 6 year old granddaughter. She loved them. My son loves this!Great quality and great price! I am a huge fan of Tootlemania and this is by far my favorite. The paint is very vibrant and the pieces are very well made.,1

I love these pants but the stretchy design is just too tight. I have a wide foot and a wide foot. The fit is perfect and the fabric is soft. The material is thick and stretchy and the material feels like it will stretch,1
